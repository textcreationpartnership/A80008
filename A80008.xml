            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was not any deſire I had to appear in <hi>Publick,</hi> that incited me to ſet forth theſe D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cappel's</hi> laſt Works in <hi>Engliſh:</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious enough to my ſelf of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Neither would I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured ever to let this <hi>Tranſlation</hi> ſee the light; but that ſome Friends perſwaded me, that this piece a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Atheiſm</hi> was very ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:170457:3"/>in <hi>theſe</hi> Times, where almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body (through our late unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Diſtractions,</hi> and <hi>Toleration</hi> of the wildeſt <hi>Phanſies</hi> in matter of <hi>Divine Worſhip</hi>) is to ſeek for his Religion. And it is to be feared, that many, who profeſs outwardly the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of Religion, have yet no ſound apprehenſions of the main <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Deity: which they (I mean, moſt part of the <hi>Common</hi> people) ſeldom think of: or, if they do, they have ſuch conceptions of it, as that it would make a man of Reaſon think, he is not of the ſame kinde. So groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo abſurdly, they do talk of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and of thoſe matters in <hi>Religion,</hi> which <hi>Natural Reaſon</hi> teacheth: that I have often been
<pb facs="tcp:170457:3"/>in the mind, to think with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> that the <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Aſſes,</hi> and <hi>Hogs,</hi> did now and then animate thoſe <hi>Bodies,</hi> which are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſhape of a <hi>Man,</hi> and which are common amongſt us. But I have ſince perceived, that theſe things (for I knew not what other names to give them) were apt to be taught; that they <hi>indeed</hi> had <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and that <hi>really</hi> they were <hi>men,</hi> and therefore had <hi>Souls</hi> to ſave: which, I am ſure, they cannot do, unleſs they have a right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Deity; in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces eſpecially, where they have means enough afforded them to effect this. This ſmall Treatiſe will, I am ſure, (if read ſeriouſly, and without prejudice) help ſuch igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb facs="tcp:170457:4"/>people very much. But it is not the main end, for which it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. It is wholly to confute a company of <hi>Ruffling Fellows,</hi> who call themſelves the <hi>Strong Wits,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth! and that with an <hi>Emphaſis</hi> too: who think it is a piece of <hi>Gallantry</hi> to deny a God, and a <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and who indeed would have it ſo, for the <hi>Reaſons</hi> alleadged in the <hi>firſt Chapter</hi> of this Book. They ſhall find here ſatisfaction enough; if they do but take the leiſure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe it. I am not ignorant, that there have been many pieces made by ſundry Learned men upon this ſubject: but I never read, or heard of any, who hath handled it in this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> and ſo clearly. And, ſince I am utterly uncapable to expreſs, and ſet
<pb facs="tcp:170457:4"/>forth the <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Elogies</hi> due to the worthy <hi>Authour,</hi> I will rather chooſe to bury them in <hi>ſilence,</hi> and let him gain it himſelf, in his <hi>Book:</hi> the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of which I undertook at firſt, but to ſatisfie a Friend's deſire. I have done it as well as I could, and to a <hi>ſincere end,</hi> and therefore I do not much fear to be <hi>blamed.</hi> As for the <hi>Publication</hi> of it, your own <hi>incitement, Honoured Sir,</hi> was a ſufficient <hi>Motive</hi> to attempt it: and I do here humbly preſent it to you, as a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of that <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> I am bound to pay you, for thoſe manifold favours you have Honoured me withall; and as a <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> of that <hi>Reſpect</hi> I ow unto your <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> which is the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> God hath eminently endowed

            <head>THE AUTHOURS <hi>PREFACE</hi> TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THIS ſmall Treatiſe is not compiled with any Hopes to reduce wholly thoſe, againſt whom I argue. For ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not recall'd by Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Diſcourſes, or Humane Reaſonings. That they may be healed and converted, God himſelf muſt ſpeak, muſt ſcourge, and terrifie them, with his revengefull Judgements. The ſin of ſuch Perſons is like that of <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:170457:6"/>
               <hi>Gomorrah, viz,</hi> Pride, Fulneſs of Bread, and Abundance of Idleneſs. <hi>(Ezech. xvi. 49.)</hi> They moſt eſpecially are troubled with this Diſeaſe, who live in this World, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own deſires, who abound with the Goods of this preſent World, who are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the Wealth, Honours, Sweets, and Pleaſures of this Life: <hi>For the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the Simple ſhall ſlay them, and the Proſperity of Fools ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them;</hi> Prov. <hi>i. 32.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt they enjoy this Proſperity, and have their eaſe and quiet, they avert their thoughts from God; the Remembrance of whom would but make them ſad, and would much trouble their Repoſe, ſince they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not promiſe to themſelves any good from him, who loveth Virtue, Juſtice, and Holineſs, which in no waies is conſiſtent with that kind of Life, which they have choſen, to paſs it in Pleaſure, Delicateneſs, and Effeminacy.</p>
            <p>Then do they ſtop their Ears, as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent againſt the Charms of the Charmer, they leave off to be wiſe, and to do good; therefore they are not capable of receiving Inſtruction,
<pb facs="tcp:170457:6"/>and they would be very angry to acknowledge their Errour; becauſe, if ſo, they muſt be bound to amend their Lives, which is that they will not do, finding it wonderfully ſweet and delicious. But when they are met with by Death, and that they be a grapling with her, when ſhee doth over-power them, or when by ſome notorious, wonderfull, and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Judgement of God, they are fallen from their Greatneſs, Wealth, Goods, &amp; Pleaſures, and are reduced to the State of <hi>Job,</hi> or the <hi>Prodigal Son</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they may be healed, then their affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience doth awake them from their deep ſlumber; then at ſometimes they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their eyes to the acknowledgement, and deteſtation of their Errour. Without this, they are like thoſe, who, being ſick of a Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, may be pinch'd, ſpoken to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet never budg, nor will not awake; becauſe they take more pleaſure in their ſleep, and drowſineſs, which at laſt layes them in their Grave.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe is rather intended to theſe ends: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, To keep from this horrible Precipice
<pb facs="tcp:170457:7"/>thoſe, that have ſome Natural bent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination that way. For the general, and Natural Corruption of man is to them an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Maſter, and Teacher of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> which now and then ſuggeſts theſe thoughts into their hearts; <hi>Who hath told you that there is a God, whom you never ſaw?</hi> And, <hi>Where have they learn'd it, who taught you this? What greater aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this have they themſelves?</hi> And, <hi>Whence did it proceed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is to uphold their Faith, in whom theſe thoughts have taken ſome Impreſſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To ſhew the miſtake of thoſe, who think, that, ſetting aſide the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word of God, thoſe perſons (<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Atheiſts</hi>) are not void of Reaſon, and ſpeak not without ſome warrant. For it is here ſhewed, that they oppoſe Reaſon, and bely it in divers manners.</p>
            <p>Finally, This is to beat down, in ſome manner, the vain-glory, and the profane mockings of thoſe perſons, who laugh at the ſimplicity (as they think) of the World, which is of ſo light a belief, (as they call it)
<pb facs="tcp:170457:7"/>as to give credit to thoſe Writings, which are called the <hi>Bible,</hi> without any more warrant of their Belief, then the common Report, or an hear-ſay, or elſe the Teſtimony of ſome men, that take upon them the Authority to give to theſe Sacred Writings the Credit, which it hath amongſt us, and yet cannot in any other ways ſhew, upon what their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is grounded; and thereby do weaken the Faith of thoſe, who are taught to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more then meer Reaſon to the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Books and Sacred Writers. For here it is ſhewed againſt the <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> that they make themſelves abſurd and ridiculous in doubting, without any appearance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of the Authority of theſe Sacred Books.</p>
            <p>It is now three years ago, ſince this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe was dictated to ſome young Divines in this place, without any other Deſign, then their own ſatisfaction; and this was alſo done at their Requeſt, and to be to them as a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> and Foundation of their Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For it is that by which we muſt begin, <hi>That there is a God:</hi> which many do not know, but becauſe they have heard other ſay
<pb facs="tcp:170457:8"/>ſo, without having pondered and examined upon what ground this Common belief is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But ſince that time, after this ſmall piece had been viewed and approved by able <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> to whoſe Judgement I (as it is my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) do ſubmit: I, by their perſwaſions, have thought that this, being made publick, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any harm to any, and may profit ſome. And this the rather; that I might evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that we ought to ſerve God to the utmoſt of our abilities, in maintaining his cauſe againſt his moſt furious Adverſaries; and that thoſe of our Coat, and Profeſſion, are not ſuch, as ſome would willingly make the world believe them to be, <hi>viz.</hi> Enemies of God, and of his Truth, ſince we do (as much as in us lies) eſtabliſh the grounds of it: clean contrary to thoſe of their Profeſſion, who, feigning to lay this Foundation firm, do in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect overthrow it; ſetting it upon rotten Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and by a ſecret intelligence with thoſe enemies, againſt which they ſeem to fight, do betray, &amp; abandon that Truth, whereof they would have men believe them to be the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertours. If, by the reading of this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:170457:8"/>(which cannot much divert the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from their other employments) any find themſelves edified, and ſtrengthened in the faith and belief of this ſo important Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which is the Ground of Religion; I ſhall have attained my end, and will believe that my Meditation on this point hath not been vain. And to God, who directs by his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the thoughts of men to his own Glory, and for his own Work, be aſcribed all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Praiſe, and Glory, for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a ſtrange and wonderfull thing, that (ſeeing the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of divine and Celeſtial matters is far greater and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in moſt of men that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the Earth then ever it was) we ſee nevertheleſs more Atheiſts and profane perſons then ever were, even among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170457:10"/>which do appeare by the ſtupendous wickedneſſe, and abominable Corruption of good manners, which is at this day ſo common among Chriſtians, being moſt true which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That many do acknowledge God with their Lips, but by their works do deny him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpring of this Evill, is the unlimited Love of the Wealth, Pleaſures, Commodities, honours &amp; dignities of this preſent World. For men being hurried by their Paſſions towards theſe things, and nevertheleſſe having a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Reſentment of a Deity, and ſome Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Difference between Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, Vice and Vertue, and of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Rewards which they do juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (which is to them as moſt bitter Gall, and Wormwood, and doth deprive them of the pleaſure and content which they do take in glutting themſelves with theſe falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Goods) do endeavour to quench in themſelves this ſtrong perſwaſion they have of a Deity, or at the leaſt do frame falſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him and of his Nature, that they may go on with more looſeneſſe, leſſe Remorſe, and more pleaſure in the Execution of their evill deſires, and to fortifie themſelves in this Opinion they do ſeek, and gather all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Arguments, which the ſubtillneſſe of their Wits and Parts can furniſh them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:170457:10"/>
               <p>Now there are two ſorts of Atheiſts, the firſt are formally and openly ſo, The ſecond are cloſe and reſerved. Again of theſe firſt, there are two kinds, The firſt of which acknowledge and profeſſe that there is no God, and even do upon all occaſions, endeavour to make others beleeve the ſame: the other ſort is of thoſe which perſwade themſelves that there is no God, and notwithſtanding dare not vent that Opinion openly either for fear of the Juſtice of men which doth moſt juſtly chaſtice and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this horrible Impiety, or for ſhame of the World which doth abhor and deteſt ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as theſe.</p>
               <p>Now they, whoſe profaneneſs is not ſo open, do indeed acknowledge a Deity, but they have erroneous Opinions of it, which cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the Reality of its Nature. The God of ſuch perſons is nothing elſe but an Idoll, a Falſe God, and only a Phantaſme of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, now he that hath but this is not far from Atheiſme.</p>
               <p>Of all theſe Opinions ſome are more groſs and leſs agreeing with the Nature of the Deity, the other are more ſubtill and harder to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, which nevertheleſs do oppugne its Nature, and cannot really agree with the true Deity.</p>
               <p>Of the former is the Tenet of <hi>Epicurus</hi> who did acknowledge a Deity, but ſuch a one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170457:11"/>as had nothing to do with the World, and had neither made it, nor did governe it, and was without any care what was done in it. Next to this was the Opinion of the Peripateticks, who did hold that there was a firſt matter, but to whom they did attribute only the moving of the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> and a generall and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated Action without any Cognizance or Government of particular things, who was neither the efficient cauſe of this world, which they did aſsert had beene from all Eternity without any Beginning. The ſame alſo was the Opinion of the Heathen, who did believe a Plurality of Gods, either Independent one upon another, or generated and procreated the one by the other, to which alſo they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed humane Paſſions and Affections, as Anger, Envy, Carnall Luſts, Joy, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of falſe Opinions, more cunning and ſubtile, is of thoſe who cannot think that God is infinitely juſt, or infinitely mercifull, but beleeve that he pardons Sin without puniſhing of it, and that he doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it only becauſe it is his pleaſure, ſeeing that he could abſtain from the puniſhing of it if he would, and that he could (if he pleaſed) be unwilling to puniſh it. Which Opinion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries this with it, that Good and Evill are not ſo in their Nature, but only as it pleaſeth God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170457:11"/>to command the one, and forbid the other, and hence it followes that he could forbid the Good and command the Evill, and this doth transforme God in the Principle of the ancient and abominable Heretick <hi>Manes,</hi> who becauſe of the difference of Good and Evill, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute two Principles of them, the one good and the other evill; nay, theſe do worſe then him, ſince they holding one Principle, make it ſuſceptible of both, <hi>viz</hi> Good and Evill.</p>
               <p>Thoſe alſo that will not acknowledge that God is ſuch as he hath revealed, and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known in his word, <hi>viz.</hi> One in three diſtinct perſons, and by his Eternall word Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his Son, who was incarnate, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for to ſave the world, ſuch are thoſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hereticks who have reſiſted the moſt holy and moſt happy Trinity, and our Saviours In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, together with the Diſciples and followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who is by them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Chriſt. For all ſuch perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a falſe pretence they have of maintaining the Unity of God, do annihilate him as much as in them lyes, in crying down his Power and Eternall Wiſdome, which are the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, and would have them to be only bare names, phantaſmes or meer creatures.</p>
               <p>There might be added many other opinions, Ancient and Modern, as namely that of old, of the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> that thought God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170457:12"/>to be corporeall, and that he was furniſht with Armes, Leggs, and Eyes like a man: From whom do not go very far thoſe who erect Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Holy Trinity to adore and ſerve it. All ſuch Opinions are intirely unworthy, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated from the Infinite Excellency of God, do beget in the Spirits of men a falſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and a meer Phantaſme of the Deity, and do avert men from the true Feare, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, Obedience, Piety, and Honour, which his Creatures are bound to pay him.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another Riſe and Root of this Prophaneneſs, and as it is more hid and ſubtle, ſo it is more generall and common, <hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe who do indeed acknowledge a Deity, and have no erroneous opinions of its Nature, but nevertheleſs would be very glad, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly could wiſh that there were no God, and that for the ſame end and reaſon, as thoſe have, who endeavour to perſwade themſelves that there is none, to wit, that they may more licentiouſly follow their evill deſires, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences.</p>
               <p>And this Wickedneſs is ſo common, that there are none but the truly faithfull, and thoſe who are regenerated by the Spirit of God, that are wholly free from this, and alſo to theſe ſomt mes ſuch thoughts come into their Hearts when they are tempted and enticed by their own Luſts, which is like a Spring of Gall ſpout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170457:12"/>on high with which they are defiled, which they reſiſt as much as they can by the efficacy of the Spirit of God.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Two Waies of Convincing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Authority.</head>
               <head type="sub">I. Argument, Drawn from this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the World hath had a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</head>
               <p>THere are two waies of handling a ſubject, the firſt to prove poſitively that it is, and what it is, the ſecond to confute that which may be brought againſt it. We purpoſe to our ſelves here only to prove againſt Atheiſts, that there is a God, &amp; not to anſwer to all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs and ſubtilty of humane reaſon (ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; prone to its own Ruin) can bring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it ſelfe the contrary, becauſe that as there are common Truths ſo clear and evident
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170457:13"/>that no Sophiſme or Paralogiſme can make us to ſwerve from it, though (it may be) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſsolve and untie the Knot of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſme; ſo this truth, that there is a God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well and ſolidly proved and demonſtrated, there will be no Argument (though never ſo artificiall) that ſhall make us to decline it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we could not clearely ſee which way we might diſ-intangle our ſelves and come out from theſe Labyrinths. Unleſſe we perchance were of the number of thoſe (of whom we have heretofore ſpoken) who ſhould be very willing that there were no God: For we glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve, and eaſily perſwade our ſelves, that which we deſire; we our ſelves give weight and ſtrength to thoſe Arguments which do inforce it upon us, and contrarily weaken, as much as in us lies, thoſe that oppoſe them. Hence cometh to paſs, that this day ſo many give ear to Atheiſticall Doctors, and are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded to credit their abominable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, which is prejudiciall to themſelves, and an Argument of the weakneſs of their cauſe, for it is no wonder eaſily to beleeve that which is vehemently deſired.</p>
               <p>Now there are two wayes of proving a thing. The firſt by Reaſon, The ſecond, by Teſtimony and Authority. The laſt is more curt and eaſie, but ſometimes more doubtfull and leſs certain, and that it may be made valid,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170457:13"/>and firm, it muſt be demonſtrated, that he who gives this Teſtimony firſt, knowes and underſtands well what he ſaith. Secondly, That he is true and faithfull, and that he is neither able or willing to lye and deceive, and that there is no reaſon to ſuſpect him of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and malice, and in this caſe the proof is certaine and evident. And of this kind of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony we ſhall ſay ſomething towards the end of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The Deity may be proved by many Reaſons of which we ſhall ſelect ſome of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, upon which we nevertheleſſe will not more enlarge, then it ſhall ſuffice to ſhew the force and validity of them.</p>
               <p>Among all thoſe Reaſons that prove a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, this may be the firſt. To wit, That this World neceſſarily hath had a Beginning, and conſequently a Maker, (which hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, and hath given it its Being) which cannot be ſuppoſed to have been any other but God.</p>
               <p>There are two Wayes of proving a thing by Reaſon. Firſt is, That which Philoſophers call <hi>a Priori,</hi> in coming down from the Cauſe to the Effects, and demonſtrating the Effects by the Cauſes. The ſecond <hi>a Poſteriori,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from the Effects to the Cauſe, and proving the Cauſe by the Effects. This firſt kind of Demonſtration cannot be here admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170457:14"/>for there is nothing above or before God by which its Being may be demonſtrated, it cannot therefore be proved but by his Effects only. And here we may take notice of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his miſtake, who did acknowledge a Deity but which was neither the Cauſe of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, nor did any wiſe Governe it. For from whence could he know or acknowledge a Deity, but from the Conſideration of this World as its Effect? Such an Opinion as this he could not get by Revelation, ſeeing that according to his Tenent, it did not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or meddle with mens affaires, and beſides that he would not admit any ſuch Revelations. From whence it is clear, that it hath only been an <hi>Artifice</hi> of this Philoſopher to ſhun the hatred and deteſtation of men which he had incurred if he had wholly and openly denyed the Deity.</p>
               <p>The Deity therefore can neither be known nor proved, but by the due Conſideration of its effects, from which diverſe Reaſons may be drawn, and from this firſt way, the Deity may be thus inferred.</p>
               <p>Nothing can produce its own ſelfe, for if it was ſo, then that thing ſhould be afore it was, which is abſurd, and implyes a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: It neceſſarily then followes, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the World hath been from Eternity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Beginning, or elſe that it hath had a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170457:14"/>Beginning: For there is no <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt theſe Termes, <hi>It hath not beene, nor could be from Everlaſting, and without a Beginning;</hi> which might be proved by Divers Arguments, but we will content our ſelves with two or three. The firſt of which is, That if the world were Eternall, there ſhould be not only one Number but many, yea almoſt infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers really, and actually infinite, which cannot be, and is manifeſtly Repugnant to Reaſon; For there, is not, or can be conceived any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, let it be never ſo great, but that there may be added to it, not only an Unite, but any other Number whatſoever, let this Number be imagined to be ſo great as it can.</p>
               <p>And that which is yet more unconceiveable, goes beyond all Abſurdities, and implyes a manifeſt Contradiction is, that there ſhould be many Numbers really, and actually infinite, which ſhould be leſſer or greater then ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are ſuppoſed to be infinite, which is abſurd. To the infinite nothing can be added; all infinite things conſequently ought to be equal. Now if this World is Eternall, the Heavens have turned from all Eternity, and if they have alwayes turned without any Beginning of this Circumvolution; there hath hitherto been a Number actually infinite of their Revolutions, becauſe aſcending from this dayes Revolution, we ſhall never find an end of theſe Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170457:15"/>ſince they are ſuppoſed to have had no Beginning: So in this Eternity there hath been an infinite number of years (ſince there hath been an infinite Number of theſe Revolutions) each of which doth make a yeare now, ſo it is that there are more Months then years, more dayes then Months, more houres then dayes, and more minutes then houres, ſo that (as I have ſaid) there hath beene in this Eternity divers Numbers, each of which is actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and nevertheleſſe ſome are greater then others. Likewiſe upon this ſuppoſition there hath beene an infinite number of Trees and plants ſucceeding the one to the other by that perpetuall viciſſitude which is perceived in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now in a Tree there are many greater Branches upon one ſtock, many leſſer Branches upon greater Branches, and finally more Leaves then Branches: And conſequently the number of Trees, Branches, and Leaves, will be actually infinite, and nevertheleſſe the number of Leaves ſhall be greater then that of the Branches, and the number of Branches greater then that of the ſtocks. The ſame may be ſayd of men and of all other bodies which conſiſt of many parts, for in a man there are more fingers then armes, more haires then heads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover in this ſuppoſed Eternity, there hath been an infinite number of dayes, and an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170457:15"/>infinite number of nights, now the day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes the night, or the night the day in reſpect of each Hemiſphere, which we take it matters not, for it will alwaies follow that in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, there hath been a number actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite either of nights or of dayes, which ſhall be leſſer or greater then another infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by an Unit, for neceſſarily in either of the Hemiſpheres there are more daies then nights by one, and more nights then daies by one.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Generation of men, and the manner of it, as we do apprehend it, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Eternity of the World. And that firſt, becauſe if the World is eternall, an infinite number of men have beene before theſe that live this day upon the face of the Earth; and an infinite number alſo of thoſe who lived a thouſand years ago, and infinite thoſe who are ſuppoſed to have lived ten thouſand yeares ago, and ſo conſequently to the infinite; ſo that there are infinite numbers that are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, which nevertheleſſe are leſſe then ſome others alſo infinite. For to the infinite number of thoſe who have preceded ten thouſand years ago, we muſt of neceſſity add thoſe who have been ſince theſe ten thouſand years.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the generation of men this is a generall note, that men who this day are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (taken not each one apart but every one together) have more Fathers then Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170457:16"/>more Grandfathers then great-Grand-fathers, for each man hath his own Father, but many men have the ſame Grand-father, and the ſame Grand-father hath many more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his Children then the Father; ſo that going upwards we ſhall ſee the number of <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors</hi> to diminiſh, from whence it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily concluded, that at laſt we muſt come to a firſt Father, who had no Anceſtors, but is the <hi>Origin</hi> and ſpring of all the reſt. Which Foundation being layd, it muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there was an infinite time in which there was no Generation of men; or that the World hath exiſted for an infinite time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any men before the production of this firſt, now neither can be aſſerted or maintained with the leaſt appearance of Reaſon. For how ſhould this man have thought of generating af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had exiſted from Eternity without Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating? The ſame queſtion cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt us of God, why, and how he ſhould have thought of creating the World af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had exiſted for an infinite number of Ages without creating: for the Eternity of God is not a ſucceſſive time, as the pretended Eternity of the World is, where neceſſarily ſome moments follow the others, ſince Gods Eternity is alwaies indiviſible, and where there is neither <hi>A prius</hi> or <hi>poſterius,</hi> firſt or ſecond.</p>
               <p>Moreover, The Hiſtory of things paſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170457:16"/>to this pretended Eternity of the World, for if it had exiſted from the very Depth of Eternity, ſo that there have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies men upon the Earth, whence doth it come to paſſe, that aſcending to, and looking over things paſt, we cannot finde any Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Remembrance of things done above five or ſix thouſand years ago? Experience teacheth us, that the longer a man lives, the more doth he take notice of the Events that befall in his life time: By ſo much the more as Commonalties and Corporations do laſt, by ſo much do they poliſh and refine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and do alſo leave more Monuments of their Actions. If therefore the World and its Inhabitants were only but from fifty thouſand years ago, we ſhould have at this day ſome Monuments of their Hiſtories very cleare and diſtinct, at leaſt from above ten thouſand years ſince (eſpecially) that the World being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent; according to our Hypotheſis of five thouſand years, and a little above, we only have Monuments of Hiſtories that are evident but from two thouſand years.</p>
               <p>That which can be excepted againſt the forementioned Argument is, that there have been Deluges, and Univerſall Inundations, that have aboliſhed all the preceding Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all men that then were exiſtent, beſides one or two, or ſuch a ſmall number to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170457:17"/>Repleniſh the Earth. But that they may ſolve the forenamed Argument, they muſt aſſert that there have been infinite Inundations of the like Nature (otherwiſe we ſhall alwaies aſcend to a man that was in the Beginning, the ſpring and Riſe of all the reſt, who exiſted from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity without generating) which Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is lyable to many inconveniences, and may be evinced with many ſtrong Arguments. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that thoſe give themſelves a great deal of Liberty, who will conclude an infinite number of Inundations from that which (as we do all agree) did once come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Moreover if we grant Inundations of the ſame Nature, we muſt alſo acknowledge a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which muſt governe and guide them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe how can it come to paſſe that from each one of theſe deluges, there ſhould be ſome men preſerved to people the Earth again, for if they did happen by chance only, we cannot imagine but that ſome of them, yea the moſt part of them ſhould have wholy aboliſhed and Raced from the face of the Earth, all men and beaſts without any exception, ſince it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Hiſtory of this of which we do agree, that men and beaſts have been preſerved by a ſingular, and admirable Providence of the Deity, without which, man could not have eſcaped it without a great deale of danger; much leſſe preſerve with himſelfe all parts of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170457:17"/>Beafts. For to aſſert with <hi>Ovid</hi> in his <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis</hi> drawne from other Pagan Fables, That beafts have formed themſelves out of the mud after this Inundation, is not to ſpeak like a Philoſopher, or a Rationall man: Such as thoſe would appeare to be who do oppugne a Deity. Add to this, that if the like Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had frequently hapned, there ſhould without doubt have remained ſome Memory of them. And the firſt that ſhould have eſcaped it, would have transferred the Monument of it to their iſſue, and theſe to them that ſhould have ſucceeded them, and ſo from hand to hand we ſhould have Records of many like Inundations which is very falſe.</p>
               <p>Finally, This Argument which the Atheiſts do aſſume, drawne from the Eternity of the World may be retorted againſt them, for if a thing Corporeall, Finite, Materiall, ſo groſs, and ſo imperfect as this World is, can never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe have been, and ſubſiſted from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, as now it is exiſtent; how much more is it according to right Reaſon to conſtitute a ſpirituall, immateriall, infinite, and eternall Eſſence, ſubſiſting of it ſelfe which is nothing elſe but the Deity? For by how much the more things are immateriall and ſpirituall, by ſo much the greater activity have they, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are more able to ſubſiſt and laſt lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170457:18"/>as is ſeen in Soules, Angells, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>Moreover we ſee that this World is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible almoſt in all its parts, which are in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual viciſſitudes &amp; changes of being and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which doth argue that it draweth towards its end, and that finally it will be diſſolved, for the whole participates of the Nature of its parts, and cannot be contrary to them, now how can that have been from all Eternity, and without any Beginning, that draweth to an end, and that at laſt will come to it? For if hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it hath endured infinitely, it may do the ſame for the future, if it cannot laſt for the future, it is clearly evident that it cannot have beene from all Eternity. If then the World hath neither been, nor can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have exiſted from all Eternity, it hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily had a Beginning, and ſince nothing can produce it ſelfe, we muſt conclude, That it hath been produced by ſome one that hath had no Beginning, but hath been from all Eternity, who is no other but God himſelfe; otherwiſe we muſt affirm that this Architect of the world hath been produced by ſome other, and this alſo by another, and ſo to the infinite, which is groſſely abſurd.</p>
               <p>Thoſe do not much more further the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts cauſe, who from all Eternity do conſtitute a confuſed Chaos, and a firſt matter of this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170457:18"/>World from which it hath been extracted. For firſt, It is a thing beyond imagination that that which is only a meere <hi>Power</hi> without any forme, ſuch as the firſt matter is ſuppoſed to be, hath, or can have of it ſelfe ſo much ſtrength as to have ſubſiſted from Eternity, or that a conſuſed and indigeſted matter, ſuch as the Chaos is imagined to be, could have exiſted infinitely in an equall Conſuſion. Beſides, thoſe that are of this Opinion, as <hi>Plato, &amp;c.</hi> have been forced to acknowledge a Workman and Architect ſupreamly wiſe and induſtrious, <hi>viz.</hi> The deity which hath extracted this order, which we now ſee out of the Confuſion of this Chaos, and hath reduced that Power of the firſt Matter into Act, who hath formed ſo wonderfull a Workmanſhip out of ſo confuſed a Matter, which had it not been for ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power as this is, it might have for ever remained in its Diſorder and Confuſion: for why ſhould it have beene otherwiſe, and why ſhould have Order ſprung out of Diſorder in ſuch or ſuch a moment, rather then at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, unleſſe it were by the meanes of a ſuperior power, and a free Agent who hath compoſed it according to his Will? As of a maſſie Clay, no veſſell can be formed without the induſtrious and artificiall hand of the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:170457:19"/>
               <p>For as to this new and admirable Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, greater Mathematician then Naturaliſt, who will renovate the Doctrine of <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus's Atoms</hi> (moving themſelves not in a <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> and infinite ſpace, but in us I know not what Quinteſſence hitherto ignored, which runs and paſſes betweene them as ſmall leaves and ſtrawes, through the Thornes of a thick Hedge) who requires that there may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him a certain matter, and he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that out of it may come forth, and form it ſelfe ſuch a World as this is. When he hath put forth his demonſtrations upon that Point, it will be ſeene whether this his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is as well grounded as that of his Maſter <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who deſired that there might be aſſigned him a fixed and immoveable point, and he would remove the Earth and all the World out of its place, and tranſport it into another.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The ſecond <hi>Argument</hi> againſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſme, Drawn from the Order and Diſpoſition of this World.</head>
               <p>IT is a Difference, ſeen and noted by all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Caſuall things, and thoſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Prudence and Reaſon, that in thoſe things which are Fortuitous, and Caſuall, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Order, nor Diſpoſition is perceived: but only a confuſed mixture of things; in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is deprehended, Order, and Right diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and a certain Symmetry and compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from which doth proceed an Agreeable, and Gracious Beauty; and the more the Workman is induſtrious, able, and expert, the more is ſeen in his Works, Order, and due Diſpoſition; as for example, other are the Magnificent buildings of great Kings, and the ſmall Cottages ſeen in Country Villages, or thoſe paſtimes of Children, who preſume to build Caſtles and Houſes, of ſmall pieces of brick, and chips of wood.</p>
               <p>In the Compoſure and Edifice of this great Univerſe, and of the liltle World, Man; one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170457:20"/>muſt needs be very blinde, who doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in it an Order, a Diſpoſition, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Proportions, and Symmetry, in all it's parts, which is exceeding admirable, and hath raviſhed out of themſelves thoſe among the very Heathens, who have narrowly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, and hath forced them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Deity, from which this Order is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>Such an Order and Diſpoſition, and theſe ſo wonderfull Proportions can neither be an effect, or Production of a blinde and fortuitous fate: but, we muſt in this acknowledge a Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Prudence, and Induſtry, above any mans reach of apprehenſion, that hath ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered theſe things. For any Man to ſay, that they have alwayes continued ſo, without any beginning, and that therefore they have no Creator, is that which we have Confuted in the preceding Chapter, and moreover, it is that which can neither be comprehended, nor imagined; that ſo admirable an Order ſhould not proceed from any cauſe, and were not the product of Superior Wiſdom. Now, what can be this Wiſdom, but the Deity it ſelf? for any man to refer this to a Vertue Phyſicall, Irrationall, <hi>&amp; ſui neſcia,</hi> diffuſ'd, and ſcattered thorough this great Maſſe of the World, as thoſe Philoſophers, which, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, did imagine, that there was a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170457:20"/>ſoul of the World, almoſt like that Power we ſee ſeeds to have, in producing Plants, Trees, and Animalls, is an error, want of right reaſoning, <hi>&amp; Petitio Principii,</hi> for that vertue we deprehend in ſeeds, could not produce effects ſo wonderfull in the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Symmetry of all parts of bodies which ſpring from thence, unleſſe it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a Superiour cauſe, moſt wiſe, and full of admirable induſtry. Since a thing that is irrationall, and inanimate, cannot be a fit ſubject of ſo marvellous a Wiſdom, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable an induſtry.</p>
               <p>Again, this imaginary ſoule of the World, ſo diffuſ'd thorough this vaſt body, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an Animall (as man, who is compoſed of body and ſoule) or not. If it doth not make an Animall, it doth not informe this great and Maſſie body; but hath it's Subſiſtency by it ſelfe, if it ſubſiſts by it ſelfe; here is by their own Conceſſion, and Confeſsion, a thing im materiall, Incorporeall, that is infinitely wiſe, and infinitely Powerfull, ſince it produceth ſo ſo many, and ſo wonderfull effects; and what is that but the Deity of which is our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute? for, this ſoule which is ſo wiſe, and mighty, muſt of neceſsity have been from all Eternity; and muſt have made and ordered this World as it's efficient cauſe, and yet it muſt be ſeparated from it, ſince it is not the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170457:21"/>forme that doth animate it, as the ſoule doth the body of Man. Now, what needs rather to aſſert that there is ſuch an efficient cauſe, all wiſe, and all mighty, which hath from all Eternity, made and compoſed this World, and ſo to caſt ones ſelfe upon the manifold, and unavoidable abſurdities, that do neceſſarily follow the aſſertion of the Eternity of the World, then with us, and the truth, to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſuch a cauſe as hath made this World, ſince only a certain ſpace of time, and by that to diſintangle ones ſelfe from thoſe Labyrinths and inevitable abſurdities.</p>
               <p>If they ſay, that this ſuppoſed ſoule of the World doth informe its matter, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a naturall compoſure, ſuch as the ſoule, and body doth conſtitute a Man, then this world muſt needs be a great, vaſt, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Animall, which is compoſed of parts that are not organicall (as the limbs, and parts of a humane body are) and muſt have ſome correſpondency and proportion with the forme, and the ſoule which animates them, which is a frantick, and wilde imagination; unworthy, not only of Philoſophers (ſuch as theſe would be thought to be) but even of men, of mean and low capacities; but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this only followes, that according to this ſuppoſition, and conceſsion of the Atheiſts, we have here a great, and almoſt infinite Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170457:21"/>Eternall, Almighty, and all wiſe, from which all things that are ſeen are produced, as ſo many effects of its wiſdom and Power. Now, how neere comes ſuch an imagination to that which we ſay is the Deity? but that it is much more conſonant to reaſon, and to that Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Majeſty of this wiſdome, and Power to place it (as we do) by it ſelfe, and ſeparated from the matter, immenſe, infinite, ſubſiſting of it ſelfe, and by it ſelf, then with them to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it informes ſo vile and groſſe a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as this of the world is, and to ſhut it up within the precincts of this world, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſubſiſting out of it. For, this is to make it finite, and Limited, in reſpect of its extenſion; now, if in this reſpect it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and limited, why then not alſo in reſpect of its duration? So, that according to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of thoſe perſons, we muſt at laſt come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to this, that this world hath made it ſelf, or rather is riſen out of nothing, without the helpe of any cauſe, and that in a certain time, which is a very wilde, and abſurd imagination. And if this wiſdom and Power is infinite, in reſpect of its duration, being eternall (as they ſay it is) why ſhall it not alſo be infinite in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its extenſion? and if they ſay it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite as to its extenſion, it exiſts, and ſubſiſts without this world, and out of it, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily we muſt affirm to be finite, ſeeing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170457:22"/>there is no body (no more then number) act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually infinite. So are they compelled to avouch a Wiſdom, and Power immateriall, infinite in all its acceptions, as well in reſpect of its extenſion, as of its duration, ſubſiſting of it ſelf, and from all Eternity, and ſeparated from all matter, which is nothing elſe but that which every one meanes by a Deity. And here we may take notice of the impertinency and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of the opinion of <hi>Democritus,</hi> and of <hi>Epicurus</hi> after him, that would have had this world to have been framed by a fortuitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Atoms,</hi> moving themſelves caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in an infinite Vacuum, and in an infite ſpace of time alſo; for, beſides the abſurdity, there is, in imagining to ones ſelf, ſmall indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible bodies, which, nevertheleſſe have little hooks, by which they catch one another, and ſo concurr together in the produceing of any thing, as thoſe people did fancy, and beſides that, it is unimaginable, that in ſo minute, bodies, ſuch as thoſe are, there ſhould be found various, and infinite qualities, which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in the bodies compoſed of them; or, if they be without any quality, that out of their concourſe there ſhould ſpring forth ſo many, and ſo various qualities; there is yet this very palpable abſurdity, which is, that out of ſo fortuitous and caſuall concourſe, which is not directed by any Superiour intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170457:22"/>there ſhould be produced a work ſo admirable, as the world is, all the parts of which are conformed with ſuch a Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Symmetry, that it confounds the thoughts of thoſe who do ſedulouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and ſo conſtant a duration of this order in the perpetuall ſucceſſion of bodies, which we ſee are formed by nature, and again, that if by this fortuitous concourſe, the world hath been ſo made by the ſame motion of thoſe <hi>Atoms,</hi> it may likewiſe be diſſolved, and ſo we muſt imagine in an Eternity, an infinite number of worlds made, and again diſsol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſucceſſively, one after another, by the motion, and fortuitous concourſe of <hi>Atoms,</hi> and by this is deſtroyed the pretended E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of this world: for the defending of which, the Atheiſts do ſo much trouble themſelves.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> A third <hi>Argument,</hi> Drawn from the Difference, which is between Vice and Vertue.</head>
               <p>AS in the works of Nature, there is that Symmetry, and wonderfull diſpoſition; ſo well managed, ſo conſtant and regular, (of which hath been ſpoken in the precedent chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that it doth clearely evidence to us, an admirable and infinite wiſdom, which is the Author of it; ſo alſo in humane things, even in the actions of men, and in the products and emergencies of their intellects and wills, we may plainly ſee an Order and Symmetry, ſo wonderfull, that it cannot be conceived to be a product of fate, from which nothing but confuſion doth proceed.</p>
               <p>This Principally doth appeare in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſubtlety of a mans Spirit, and in the effects of theſe faculties of his Soule, or in the rectitude of his actions, flowing from the practicall part of his ſoul, which is called Morall vertue, both of which do point at ſomething of Divine in Man, and which cannot have its birth from a fortuitous and blinder cauſe, that is ſuppoſed to act
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170457:23"/>without Knowledge, and from this alſo is drawn another Argument againſt Atheiſme, of which we will treat in its place.</p>
               <p>To this Virtue and Morall good, Evill, Sin, and Vices are oppoſed, which oppoſition doth not wholy depend on mans Free Will, (for things of this Nature eaſily do change and vary) but this difference of Good and Evill, Vice and Virtue is fixed and altogether immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and is ſo deeply tooted in the heart of man, who doth naturally know it, that all the men in the World cannot alter it, and it will be knowne by them even in deſpight of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for the moſt barbarous and deſperate, although they be Virtues grand Adverſaries, cannot but often admire its Excellency, and highly value it where ſhee is found, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they many times know not the Vice, which reſides in their hearts, and the evill A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which they (blinded by their Paſſions) do commit, yet they will with facility depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it in others, and deteſt and condemn it, if eſpecially it turns againſt their intereſt, and to their prejudice: And as all acknowledge the Beauty and Excellency of Virtue, and the deformity of its contrary, <hi>Vice;</hi> ſo all agree in this, that the former calls for the Love, Praiſe, and Commendation of men: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, that the latter is worthy of the bitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt hatred, and of all mens deteſtations, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170457:24"/>ought to draw after it ſelfe ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as its due, from thence we draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Argument againſt Atheiſme.</p>
               <p>This difference of Good and Evill is not a meer Fancy and Opinion, but Eſſentially reall as in naturall things, Black and White, Light, and Darkneſſe; Neither doth it proceed from any cuſtome, that by degrees hath gained upon mens minds, for that which comes by cuſtome doth grow by little and little, and is weaker in the bud then afterwards, may be altered eaſily, and inſenſibly turnes to nothing, which is not ſeen in the difference of Good and Evill, which hath alwaies beene deepely rooted in all mens Hearts at all times, and more ſtrong perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were there of it in the Beginning then now in this age, where the Corruption of men is ſtronger then ever.</p>
               <p>And this cannot be aboliſhed by any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cuſtome, for it alwaies remaines the ſame in it ſelfe. The Lawes of Magiſtrates, or the Morall Precepts of Philoſophers, have not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Virtue its Being, they have only appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it in the Actions, and Deportments of men, and according to their apprehenſions they have framed their Precepts and Lawes to rule the lives of men, and to hinder them from Vice its contrary. As we may ſay of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> That he hath not meerly invented out of his owne Brain the Rules and Precepts of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170457:24"/>but only hath framed them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Remarks which he hath made of all mens Diſcourſes and Arguments. And upon theſe Remarkes, hath compiled his <hi>Organon,</hi> where the Rules of Argumentation are layd, which are neither mutable or arbitrary, but certain and unchangeable, effected upon the right and Naturall Reaſon common to all men.</p>
               <p>This Virtue hath its Riſe and Foundation in Mans Nature, as he is Rationall, and endowed with that Will and Underſtanding which ought to have the Supremacy over the Affections, and to hold them in their Right Compaſſe, and this doth conſiſt in the <hi>Symmetry,</hi> and proportion which is in the Rationall Souls Faculties, from this doth ſpring forth the Beauty and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of virtue, which doth compel the moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to admire it; as in Bodies &amp; Works, either artificiall or naturall, their Beauty proceeds from the due Poſition of all their parts, for the one is no more Arbitrary or Imaginary then the other, but both are True and Reall, that of Virtue being ſo much the more glorious, as the ſpirituall exceed the Corporeall in worth and dignity.</p>
               <p>This Virtue as we have deſcribed it, cannot proceed from a blind fate, or fortuitous cauſe which can produce nothing well regulated, but ought to have a moſt certain, conſtant, and invariable Cauſe, which hath in it ſelfe all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170457:25"/>of virtues in the higheſt Degree, which is the moſt perfect pattern, and the exacteſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of all humane Virtues, and which is the Author and efficient cauſe of it in man, ſeeing it cannot come from any other principle, which (if it were ſuppoſed) would be much leſſer then its Effect, for there is nothing in all that man can imagine in Nature, more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and excellent then Virtue, by which man is not only infinitely more excellent then beaſts, but is in ſome manner deified, and in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſurpaſſes himſelfe. And here we need not to conſtitute two Principles, with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,</hi> the one of all good, the other of all evill, one only being ſufficient: for, as the ſtreight line is the rule of it ſelf, and of the oblique, ſo this pattern and Modell of all Vertue and perfection, which is the Deity, is the rule of all human vertues, and by it is known its contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> Vice, which of it ſelfe hath no more need of a Principle, or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe; then darkneſſe which only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the privation and abſence of light. The Spirit of Man being ſo wavering, and unconſtant, cannot be ſo good a rule of this moſt excellent and glorious vertue, as it is of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Again, that knowledge of the difference of good and evill, which all men have ſo deeply and naturally inprinted in their ſoules, doth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170457:25"/>not ſimply proceed from any Tradition, or Inſtitution, there being ſeverall barbarous Nations, who, having no ſuch Inſtitutions, nevertheleſſe acknowledge, and admire ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and highly deteſt vice: many alſo who want thoſe Traditions, or, may be, are taught the contrary to this Truth, do often (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their bad education) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the difference between vice and virtue. Now, from whence can proceed ſo ſtrong, lively, and conſtant impreſſion in the ſoule of man, but from ſome Superior cauſe, which hath engraved this in the Creation of it. Which cauſe can be none elſe but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, there being none but it above man to effect this.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The fourth <hi>Argument,</hi> Drawn from the diſorder which is ſeen in Man, which Diſorder, of neceſsity hath a beginning and an ending.</head>
               <p>WE have in the preceding Chapters drawn two Arguments againſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, the one from the order of Nature, and the other from Man. We will now draw one from the diſorder which is in both. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is indeed proper to Man, as he is rationall, and by it he chiefly differs from brutes, which are not capable of it; but, yet it is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or eſſentiall to him (for then man ſhould never ſin) but accidentall, from which he hath departed himſelfe; witneſſe the great corruption of manners which we ſee in the World, which of neceſsity hath had ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and cannot have exiſted from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, for diſorder is a perturbation of order, and a confuſion introducted ſince in mens natures; and that diſorder and confuſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſsibly be Eternall, is evidenced from this, that to be without a begining, is one of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170457:26"/>greateſt perfections that can be imagined. And truely, experience teacheth, that the more we go on forward, we ſee corruption to be greater and greater, and wonderfully to encreaſe; for, corruption and all evill, is at this day much rifer then it was a hundred yeares agoe, and was greater a hundred yeares agoe, then it was one hundred yeares before, which a Heathen hath very well noted about ſixteen hundred yeares ago, in theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Aetas parentum pejor Avis, tulit</l>
                  <l>Nos nequiores, mox daturos</l>
                  <l>Progeniem vitioſiorem.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And ſo going upwards, corruption will be found ſenſibly to diminiſh, untill we come unto a firſt beginning. If then Vice hath had its firſt riſe in Man, man cannot be from everlaſting; and this World of neceſsity hath had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from this, <hi>viz.</hi> (that the World was Created) we have heretofore proved a Deity that Created it; for the beginning of this corruption cannot be ſo far ſtretched upwards, but that an infinite ſpace of time preceded ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily the beginning of this corruption. Now, if man could for an infinite ſpace of time
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170457:27"/>remaine uncorrupted, why could not he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo ſtill? Add to it, that if Vice and Corruption hath begun, after an infinite time of uprightneſſe, it may juſtly be asked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath begun in one man only, or in all men at once. Which of theſe two queſtions be aſſerted, it matters not, in the aſſertion of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is a very groſſe abſurdity. For, if they ſay that it began in one man only, we may ask again, why it begun in one rather then in another? and if one was the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Vice, why the reſt did not ſuddenly diſpatch him, for fear that he might infect, and ſpoile the reſt; as at this day we ſee Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates putting the wicked to death, that they may not by their ill example, draw the reſt to their exorbitancies. And if all have at once, it is a thing beyond imagination, how it could be ſo after infinite time of their perſevering in Vertue and uprightneſs, chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if there is no other Governor of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, then the fatall order of Nature, as the Atheiſts ſay, which; doubtleſſely ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have remained the ſame, as it was before in an infinite ſpace of time, and there cannot be given, or imagined, any reaſon of ſo ſudden, and univerſall a change. The ſame cannot be objected to us, who hold, that the World and Man have had a beginning; who, though he was Created by God pure, and without
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170457:27"/>Vice, was not therefore immutable (there being nothing immutable, to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but that which is Eternall) and therefore he being naturally mutable, it is no wonder, if ſome time after he hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſome change and alteration.</p>
               <p>We have ſaid that Corruption growes more and more, but, yet it cannot grow to the infinite: both becauſe evill being a defect, and imperfection; it cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, becauſe to be infinite doth denote perfection; and alſo for that, if evill ſhould grow to be infinite, the Society of men could not ſubſiſt, but ſhould be at laſt wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, and the humane kinde annihilated by this evill, all men at laſt coming to kill and deſtroy one another, which again is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the pretended Eternity of the World, and opinion of the Atheiſts, who ſay, that as this world hath no beginning, ſo it ought to endure for ever. And the World being made for Man, and all things in it miniſtring to him; if humane kinde ſhould come wholly to periſh, as we have ſhewed it would come to paſſe, if evill grew infinitely, the root of the World would of neceſſity totally periſh, being deprived of its Principall end, which is the ſervice and good of man. It is eaſie for thoſe that conſider diligently the works of Nature, to ſee in them a wonderfull order,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170457:28"/>and a firm conſtancy, but it is alſo eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in them beſides, and againſt this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a manifeſt diſorder, and as it were an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy, or exorbitancy of nature, for, if there is in Nature a regulated and conſtant viciſsitude of the ſeaſons of the yeare, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one another, the Spring after the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Summer after the Spring; there is in it alſo a manifeſt alteration of theſe ſeaſons, as exceſsive cold in Summer, extraordinary heat in Winter, one ſeaſon intrenches upon another; a Winter we many times ſee in the ſpring, and a Summer-in Autumn. If raine and ſnow, ice and miſts, and dewes, have their regulated times for the production of the fruits of the Earth, and to furniſh Man and all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malls with food, yet alſo, often we ſee them confuſed, and altered, hence proceed droughts, and extraordinary moiſture, which ſpoile the fruits of the Earth, and bring famine, and want of all things along with them; hence alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the corruption of the air, from which proceeds plagues, and divers kindes of epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall diſeaſes, hence proceed thunders and tempeſts, earthquakes, and ſtupendous inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and a thouſand other diſorders which are dayly ſeen in nature.</p>
               <p>Now its neceſsary that ſuch diſorders ſhould have their bounds and limits, otherwiſe what ſhould hinder diſorder from growing to the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170457:28"/>infinite, and all things from returning to their firſt <hi>Chaos,</hi> for to ſay, that theſe diſorders have their naturall cauſes from which they proceed, that is very true, but it doth not ſolve the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and doubt; for, if there is not ſome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Power, and wiſdome above nature, that doth rule and direct all theſe diſorders and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances of Nature, it will inevitably follow, that Nature will be turned upſide down, and wholly confounded, and indeed, it is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to perceive, that theſe diſorders are regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and governed by an immenſe wiſdom, and directed by an evident juſtice, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt goodneſs, in token of vengeance againſt the ſins of the one, and of bounty for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and recompenſe of others, and to refer the adminiſtration of theſe things to a fate, and blinde fortune, is to deceive ones ſelf wilfully, and to put out ones eyes on purpoſe to ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>For example, what reaſon is there to referr to a blinde fate, the deluge of <hi>Noah,</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> the ſeven yeares famine of <hi>Egypt,</hi> its manifold plagues, the peſtilences in King <hi>Davids</hi> dayes, the drought in <hi>Elias</hi> times, and a thouſand like, that happen, and may every day be ſeen in the World? This diſorder then, ſo regulated, as well as the firm and conſtant order of nature, is an Argument of a Deity moſt wiſe and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170457:29"/>and Superior to it, which hath eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this order in it, and which doth manage and containe theſe diſorders in their certain bounds, and doth direct them wiſely, juſtly, and mercifully, for the puniſhment of the one, and the bleſſing of the other.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The fifth <hi>Argument</hi> drawn from a Providence that over-ruleth all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things.</head>
               <p>WE have in the two laſt preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, proved a Deity from the order and diſorder, which is remarked in the nature of this great World, the ſame may be done from the order and diſorder which is ſeen in the little world, man, whom we do not now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as a Phyſicall, or naturall body, but as he is a morall creature, and endued with reaſon, in which reſpect we may ſee in him order, and diſorder, but yet altogether moſt wiſely regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and from theſe both is drawn another Argument to prove the Deity.</p>
               <p>And here firſt we muſt conſider, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170457:29"/>all men be of the ſame nature, we ſee nevertheleſs in them a wonderfull, and almoſt infinite variety, not only of faces and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of bodies, but alſo, and principally, of manners, of opinions, of manner of living, and of languages, and alſo a diſtinction by families, bodies, politick Comonalties, States, Republicks, Kingdomes, Empires and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, all which diſtinctions and varieties are not ſeen in other animals of the ſame kinde. This ſo wonderfull variety and diſtinction can proceed but from an infinite Wiſdom, which is above it, which hath been the cauſe of all theſe diverſities, in ſo admirable an uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature; chiefly, ſeeing that in theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties there is a ſingular Symmetry, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of all things ſo various.</p>
               <p>For to fly for the ſolution of this to a fate and fortune, which hath by meere chance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened upon this order, it is a wilfull blindneſs, for order and diſpoſition cannot proceed from that which hath none, and which, to ſay truth, is nought but a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and which hath no vertue, or efficacy, by which it may act, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing.</p>
               <p>And above all, we are in all theſe varieties to conſider that of ſpeech, which is ſo great in perſons who have all the ſame uſe of reaſon, which demonſtrateth it ſelfe by words, and all the ſame organs of the voice, from whence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170457:30"/>according to reaſon, ſhould proceed the ſame Language, the witneſſe of all our conceptions, as we ſee in other Animalls, that all thoſe that are of the ſame kinde have the ſame voice, by which they expreſſe their paſſions, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their affection.</p>
               <p>For to referr this to the free will of men, who would have it ſo, and have of themſelves framed ſo many and ſo various idioms, there is no probability, for what reaſonable end could they propoſe to themſelves in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, eſpecially ſince this diverſity of Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages doth greatly hinder the mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and communication of one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by which the Society of all humane kinde, (to which nature its ſelfe hath framed us, and powerfully enclines us) is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully interrupted and hindered, ſo that there is no reaſon, or likelihood, that men would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of themſelves to a diverſity ſo prejudiciall to them, and contrary to the end towards which they all naturally tend, which is a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Society and Communication.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this diverſity either hath been in an infinite ſpace of time, if the World hath had no beginning, or elſe this ſaid variety hath had ſome beginning; there is no reaſon to ſay that it hath had no beginning, yet being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the uniformity of Nature, which is in all men; to ſay alſo, that it hath had ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170457:30"/>there is no reaſon. For, why ſhould men (after an infinite ſpace of time, in which they are ſuppoſed to have all ſpoken one and the ſame Language) have changed in an inſtant their idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, without any reaſon, or neceſſity, and againſt the end to which they all naturally do tend.</p>
               <p>It is then neceſſary to acknowledge here a Power, and Superior Wiſdom, that, for certain reaſons, beſt known to it ſelf, beyond, and againſt the intention of men, hath brought to paſſe this admirable variety of idioms, each one of which hath its elegancies proper and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to its ſelf, and which men could not have foreſeen, or conceived in their mindes, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ſurpaſſing farr all that ordinary wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is ſeen in men, the wiſeſt of which cannot with all his wit and induſtry frame a Language, in which there may be found ſo much elegancy, and grace, as there is in either of thoſe that are now in uſe in the World, which manifeſtly evinces; that a Wiſdom, more then humane, and truely divine, hath ſo wiſely diſtributed in each of theſe Idioms all the words that make it up, with all the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and elegancies which we ſee in them.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction of men in Bodies, Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, States, Republicks, Kingdomes, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, and Monarchies, doth neceſſarily bring us to the acknowledgement of this Providence and Deity, and likewiſe ſhewes the World not to be Eternall.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:170457:31"/>
               <p>It is a thing that Nature teacheth, <hi>viz.</hi> that Fathers ought to command, govern, and have the care of their children, and Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their Grand-children, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fequently, that Anceſtors have, and take the care of their Progeny, and if this order was unchangeable, and duely kept among men, that might in ſome manner be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the regulated diſpenſations of Nature, and there would be in it nothing ſtrange, or extraordinary, but it is quite otherwiſe in the Government which is among men; for, thoſe that Command, and are at the Helme of a State, are not alwayes (nay, almoſt never,) the Grandfathers, or Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of them over whom they Rule, and are for the moſt part in no wayes allied by blood to them, therefore in this we muſt acknowledge that there is ſomething elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the right of Nature, which hath given them this Power and Authority of Ruling, which alſo muſt be very extraordinary, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they could not be ſo obeyed by thoſe who Naturally (as not being deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them) are in no wiſe their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. We may not enervate the ſtrength of this Argument, by ſaying, that a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and meerely arbitrary ſervitude, without any reaſon at all, hath by chance ſo ſubjected men one to the other; but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170457:31"/>we muſt in this acknowledge, that a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and moſt divine Wiſdome, hath enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome men above others with gifts and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties fit for Government, which have made them to be admired and reſpected by thoſe who have ſubjected themſelves to them. And in truth, Experience, and the Monuments of Hiſtory teach us, That the firſt Founder of Kingdomes, Empires, and Monarchies were men noted for the Heroick and extraordinary Vertues they had more then the reſt, by which they have gained to themſelves the admiration, Reſpect, and Obedience of thoſe that in this were their inferiours.</p>
               <p>So it is ſaid of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that firſt erected the ancienteſt Monarchy in the World, <hi>That he was a great and mighty Hunter before the Lord,</hi> that is, That he was indeed more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrius and glorious then the reſt, being endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many rare qualifications for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in which he did ſurpaſſe the reſt. So was <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Author of the Perſians Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, ſo was <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, That erected that of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and ſo were <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> which built the Romans Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and likewiſe the Scripture takes notice of all thoſe that undertooke the Rule of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God did raiſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſuch and ſuch a one.</p>
               <p>And of <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe their firſt King, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170457:32"/>God did change his Heart into that of another mans, to let us know that theſe men have been endowed with moſt excellent, Heroicall, and extraordinary Virtues above the reſt, that ſo they might command them, and that a Deity hath had the management of all this, and hath directed and excited them. And ſo by Analogy it is of all others, that have at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to rule any other Nation, People, or Common-Wealth. Moreover there being in the World ſo many divers Corporations, and ſo variouſly Rul'd and Governed, yet juſtly and with a great Order, there ſhines in this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and multiplicity of Governments, the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of a wonderfull Wiſdome which cannot proceed from the Prudence and VViſdome of any particular perſon that governs them, for this Power can extend it ſelfe no further then on their own Subjects, and therefore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily comes from ſome ſuperiour wiſdome which is above all theſe Corporations and Commonweales, and which hath ſo wiſely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and ordered them. This ſame Power or Deity is alſo neceſſary to give to every one of thoſe Corporations their regulated and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain limits, and duration in the conſtitution and determination of which this ſelfe ſame wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth appear.</p>
               <p>So we read that <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 32. Chapter of <hi>Deut.</hi> and the 8th, <hi>verſe,</hi> doth attribute to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170457:32"/>God the ſeverall habitations of all Nations upon the face of the Earth: VVhen God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to the Nations their Inheritance, when he ſeparated the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> he ſet the Bounds of the people according to the number of the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, Such a diverſity of States, Kingdomes and Mooarchies cannot have exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from everlaſting, and without a Beginning, for the ſame reaſons by which we have in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning oppoſed, and laid down the Eternity of the world, &amp; if they have had ſome Beginning, ſo the men that are Governours of them have had a Beginning alſo, and ſo conſequently the world which is made altogether for man, and if the world hath had a Beginning, there is a Creatorof it, <hi>viz. The Deity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The diſtinction of Poſſeſſions and Heritages which we ſee among men doth likewiſe make us to acknowledge a Deity, and ſo doth wholly evert the Eternity of the World. Men are not as Bruites, which poſleſſe nothing, and live upon that they meet with, and which the Earth brings forth of it ſelfe, for man poſſeſes ſomething, ſo as that it pertaineth not to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether they be moveable or not, Lands, Fields, or whatever Poſſeſſions they be.</p>
               <p>The bodies-Politick, and Commonalties have alſo their owne Limits and Diſtinctions from other bodyes, ſo States, Republicks,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170457:33"/>Empires, Kingdomes, and Monarchies, have each one of them their Limits, within which Bounds their Poſſeſſions are contained, which evidently ſhewes, that men have divided the Earth betweene themſelves, ſince that they have and poſſeſſe each one a part of it. Now if they have divided it, then there was a time when it was not divided, and if men have in a certain time begun to divide the Earth, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that they have not been alwaies upon the Earth, for what ſhould they have done upon the Earth for an infinite ſpace of time without dividing of it? and if they had alwaies been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, why did they at laſt think of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding it? And if they have began to divide the Earth, then of neceſſity there hath been a Beginning of their Beings, and a firſt Roote of them all, it being impoſſible that they ſhould have been upon the face of the Earth from all Eternity, and in the ſame number as they are now, as heretofore hath been plainly ſhewed. So from this Diviſion of the Earth, it appears that this World is not eternall, and therefore that ſince it hath a Beginning, it hath alſo an Author, to wit <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in this Partition of Lands, Goods, and worldly poſſeſſions between men, its neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that a wiſe, juſt, and powerfull Providence intervene to rule over all this, that every one may have his ſhare, otherwiſe in ſuch a Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170457:33"/>there could be but a horrible and ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Confuſion and Diſorder which would alſo deſtroy it ſelfe; for the Coveteouſneſſe of men being infinite, and without any Limits or Bounds, each man would get as much as he could to himſelfe, even to the diſadvantage of any one, unleſſe there was any one gave them a ſtint, and ſet the limits to every mans poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſuch as he judgeth convenient.</p>
               <p>And indeed, Whoſoever ſhall ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how the Earth is divided in ſeverall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, according to the diverſity of Nations, Peoples, Languages, Empires, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and how in every State or Common-Wealth, each one of their Bodies and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties have their proper and peculiar portions, and in each Commonalcy each one his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Heritages, doubtleſſe in this he ſhall finde a wonderfull Harmony, and an admirable diſpoſition, which cannot proceed from Fate and Fortune; but indubitably is from a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Wiſdome, which hath ſo managed and diſpoſed of theſe things, and given to every one ſo much as it judged fit, as a dying Father doth juſtly and wiſely give to every one of his Children their Portions to avoid the Suits and Quarrells that might ariſe among them.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction of Heritages and Poſſeſſions doth not proceed from the Fancy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd meere Will of man (ſee the forecited paſſage of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:170457:34"/>for that) but is grounded upon Juſtice and Reaſon, it proceeds I ſay from that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by which man is above bruits, and is the Foundation of all thoſe virtues which make him ſo wonderfull and excellent above beaſts, for without the diſtinction of <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine,</hi> there could not be amongſt men any Operation of Virtue. The Earth of it ſelfe brings forth, and affords to all living Creatures all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them to keep them alive, Man only excepted; therefore they have nothing of their own, but live in common with what they meet withall, but as for man, if he will ſupply his neceſſary wants, he muſt labour, till the Earth, and in ſundry manners ſeek out of it that which is profitable to, or neceſſary for him: And to this end he is endowed with Reaſon, which guides and inſtructs him in his undertakings. Now it is juſt, and conſonant to Reaſon, that every one ſhould enjoy the fruits of his Labours, and poſſeſſe the incoms of them: Add to this, that man comes naked into the World, and hath need of Cloathes to cover himſelfe, as well for decency, as to protect him from the injuries of Weather, and therefore needs a houſe alſo to ſhelter himſelfe, and of ſeverall Utenſills to ſupply the needs of this Life, which obligeth him to betake himſelfe to divers kinds of Handy-crafts, and Workmanſhips, the poſſeſſion and diſpoſition of which ought to belong to thoſe that made them.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:170457:34"/>
               <p>Moreover, Man in this differs from Beaſts, in that he ought not to follow his Luſts looſely without Rule or meaſure, but ought to be tied to one woman by an indiſſoluble Bond, and this Nature hath taught to all Peoples and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even the moſt wild and barbarous, all which of them do practiſe Marriage as a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine taught them by Nature and Reaſon: it followes then that the breeding and education of the Children which are born from Marriage, ought rather to be given them by their Fathers and Mothers then by any others.</p>
               <p>From all theſe forementioned, it appeares that the diſtinction of <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine,</hi> and the difference of Poſſeſſions of Goods and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritages, proceeds from an immutable and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Right grounded in Reaſon, Equity, and Juſtice, and not an arbitrary thing meerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the Fancy of men that would have it ſo, whence the impertinency of <hi>Plate</hi> is evident, who would in his Common Wealth have all things, even Women and Children common, for beſides that, in this ſtate of ſin which man is now involved in, ſuch a thing is both abſurd and impoſſible, and would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the ſociety of men a monſtrous confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things, I ſay that even if there were no ſins in man, and that he was in his firſt are of purity, it could not with any pretence of Reaſon have place any where, as before it hath beene ſhewed.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:170457:35"/>
               <p>Now in this difference of <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine,</hi> which is, and ought to be among men, and without which their ſociety cannot ſubſiſt, is grounde the Exerciſe of all Virtues, as of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Temperance, Truth, Fidelity, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, Liberality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This being ſo, we muſt neceſſarily acknowledge a Providence and infinite Wiſdome which hath endowed man with this Reaſon, and ground of this difference of <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine,</hi> and ſo conſequently of all Morall Virtues which all do acknowledge to be the moſt glorious, admirable, &amp; excellent things in all the world, and which could never have had for its Author, Fate, or change, or any ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationall thing, ſuch as neceſſarily the order of Nature is, unleſſe it be rul'd and governed by a ſuperiour wiſdome.</p>
               <p>If the order which is ſeen in the Actions of men, and in the regulating of their ſtates, is a ſufficient argument to inforce us to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of a Providence which over rules them, as it hath been before ſhewed, the diſorder which we evidently ſee among them, is no leſſe valid and clear to demonſtrate this ſame Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is alwaies imployed in regulating and amending of it. Now as Order in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Actions doth conſiſt in Virtue, and the Exerciſe of it, ſo the diſorder conſiſts in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and crimes which are contrary to Virtue,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170457:35"/>and as it was concluded before, that unleſſe there was a Providence to containe within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bounds the diſorders which are ſeen in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all this Maſſe of the World would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in a confuſion, and would be reſolved in its firſt Chaos, ſo we muſt confeſſe that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the lives and actions of men is ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous, and great, that unleſſe it were bridled by Providence, the Society of men could not ſubſiſt, and would be nothing elſe then meer robberies, and like enormities, every man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring as much as in him could lie to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his luſts to the prejudice of any body, and by what meanes ſoever he could deviſe.</p>
               <p>This diſorder is regulated and ſuppreſſed two manner of wayes: Firſt by Lawes, and Politick conſtitutions, the Authority and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Magiſtrates, both Supreme and inferior, and beſides this, by a Power and imperceptible inſtinct of Providence. And in this Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Lawes, and humane Policies, we muſt of neceſſity acknowledge a Providence, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them, and makes them ſtrong and valid in the ſpirits of men, for otherwiſe, who is it that would obey them, ſeeing mens corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humours and manners, to which theſe Sanctions are directly oppoſite? Againſt this, it may be, it will be objected, that neceſſity hath compelled and obliged men, to make ſuch Lawes, and to ſubmit to them, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170457:36"/>the Society of men could not ſubſiſt, and that they would devoure and kill one another. It's true indeed, that this conſideration hath been a Powerful motive to this, but yet it is not this alone which hath been the cauſe of enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lawes and Conſtituting Governments in the World. For, among theſe Lawes there are ſome, which though they do only provide for the ſafety neceſſary for Society and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as all the Lawes againſt Murther, Theft, Perjury, or falſe witneſſes; yet there are others, which concern only honeſty, Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and temperance, as Man is a rationall creature; and concerning Piety towards God, and the charity and humanity which we have one towards another, as thoſe concerning the Honor due from the children to their Parents, againſt adultery, and other exceſſes, and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of this nature, and concerning the cult due to the Deity, and the exerciſe of charity and humanity towards men, which clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, that there is ſomething elſe then this neceſsity here objected to us, that hath induced men to frame and obey ſuch Lawes, to wit, a Deity, the pattern and modell of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and which hath made man to his image and likeneſs, endowing him with reaſon, by which he might follow, and imitate them. Add to this, that if this neceſsity alone had compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led men to that, they had themſelves by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170457:36"/>conſent and advice framed theſe Lawes, and had conſtituted Magiſtrates to keep them only, reſerving the full Power and Authority to change them, add to them, or to take and diminiſh from them, and ſo to privilegiate whom they pleaſed, and to exclude them at their will, as it is done in Common-Weales, where the people is Governor, as in Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracies. But, albeit there was heretofore, and are yet ſome ſuch like Common-Wealths, yet there hath alwayes been, and are now many more bodies and Commonalties that are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Monarchically, the Lawes of which have not been erected by little and little, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeverall accaſions, by the votes and ſuffrages of the people, as at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Athens,</hi> but by ſome wiſe Law-giver, which being compiled, have ever ſince been embraced for their apparent Juſtice and equity. And the moſt ancient Law-giver of all thoſe of whom mention is made in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Moſes,</hi> raiſed manifeſtly by God, to give Lawes unto his People, and after him there have been in many corners of the World many wiſe Legiſlators, that have given Lawes to the bodies, and Comonalties of which they were members; which ſhewes, that neceſsity alone hath not brought men to the making of Lawes, and ſetting of Magiſtrates over them, but that a wiſe and Supreme Providence hath intervened, and ſtirred, and directed the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170457:37"/>Law-givers to this ſettlement, and hath uſed the conſideration of the neceſſity, there is of Lawes to make people to ſubmit to them: And which hath every where, in every State raiſed ſome one or other more noble then the reſt, for the ſingular virtues which was knowne he was endowed withall, to undertake the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Cuſtody and Preſervation of Lawes, and even whoſe will in the Beginning, was a Rule and a Law, and this was, that men might enjoy in him an Image of that ſupreame wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Power which guides and overſwaieth all this VVorld. This Providence which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth it ſelfe ſo in the curbing of evill and diſorder by the meanes of Lawes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, both ſupreame and inferiour, which he hath ſetled for the Preſervation of humane Society, is alſo plainly perceived, if we conſider the ſecret motions of it by which men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the limits of their duty, &amp; appeares yet more in this, that many particular perſons being overcome by their evill paſſions, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the feare and reverence they owe to the Lawes, do openly tranſgreſſe againſt it, and People themſelves many time riſe againſt their Supreme Magiſtrate, to diſpoſſeſſe them of their Authority. For, ſince the feare of the Lawes and Magiſtrates alone is not capable to reſtraine mens Corruptions, and their prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to evill, as it appeares by ſo many ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170457:37"/>and events, we muſt needs ſay, and confeſſe, that there is ſome Power ſtronger, that all that, and which is farr above all theſe Powers, which doth ſecretly bridle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine theſe paſſions within us; as alſo our vehement inclinations to evill, otherwiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this curb, we ſhould run on our courſes with a ſtrange impetuoſity, and turn all things up-ſide-down, and wholly diſannull the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of men. For, why ſhould not all commit the ſame extravagancies and enormities that ſome are guilty of, unleſſe there were ſome ſecret thing that reſtrains them within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? and, why ſhould not all commonalties together mutiny againſt their Magiſtrates and Governors, as ſome do, ſave only for this bridle that holds them in. Now, if all did ſo, it is evident, that no Society could in any wiſe ſubſiſt; we muſt then acknowledge from this, that there is a Providence which curbs this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent affection, which man hath towards evill, and hinders him to execute all that he would do, that ſo the Society and communication which is between men, may be preſerved, and that the Deity may be Glorified, in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement they are bound to pay him for it.</p>
               <p>If Providence doth evidence it ſelf in the reſtraint of evill, that it may not grow to the infinite, it appeares no leſs, in that it doth direct, and converts it to good, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170457:38"/>order out of confuſion, and light from darkneſſe. The order of humane actions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in their juſtice and equity, the diſorder in injuſtice.</p>
               <p>Now it is evident how great a diſorder there is in all the actions and deportments of men, witneſſe the injuſtice, and palpable wickedneſs which is ſeen among them; but, nevertheleſs, in this horrible confuſion, and diſorder, one may perceive a wonderfull order, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the events of Juſtice, Goodneſſe, and Truth, which proceed from this confuſion. For example, who doth not ſee from the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of <hi>Joſeph's</hi> brethren, ſelling him to thoſe that went to <hi>Egypt,</hi> a wonderfull effect of goodneſs, in the preſervation of all <hi>Jacob's</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily during the famine. And, in the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Nebuchodonoſor</hi> againſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which proceeded from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded ambition of this man, an example of Gods Juſtice, in chaſtiſing of this People, and finally, from the injuſtice and wickedneſs of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and the Prieſts againſt our Lord, iſſue forth a wonderfull effect of goodneſs, which is the Salvation of mankinde. It would be too long to mark and quote all the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in which the juſtice and vengeance of God againſt the ſins of men, or his goodneſs and bounty towards the other, doth manifeſt it ſelfe by the Miniſtery of wicked men, againſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170457:38"/>their intentions and deſignes, who do think nothing leſs then this, which is an evident teſtimony that there is a wiſe and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Providence, which farr ſurpaſses all the Counſell, of men, and which bowes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines their hearts, to what it pleaſeth, and doth wiſely guide their thoughts, and their hands to execute (though unwittingly) his good, wiſe, juſt, and boly will. For, to attribute unto chance and hazard, all thoſe events, in which appeares ſuch a wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Juſtice, truth, and goodneſs, would be the ſame, as if one ſhould father upon a blinde man a piece where all the glorious, wonderfulleſt, and faireſt draughts, whether of Limning, or writing ſhould appeare, and one muſt be more blinde then fortune it ſelf to beleive or think ſo. This Providence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares no leſs in the caſuall effects and events which every day happen in the World, in which appeare alſo the effects of Juſtice, goodneſs, and truth, which could not be without the direction of a Providence, which guideth all theſe events, and makes them turn alwayes to the end it hath propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf, and thoſe that take occaſion to deny the Providence, becauſe there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions and diſorders among men, and to think that all is done by chance, and do not perceive amidſt theſe confuſions the order
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170457:39"/>that may be ſeen in them, are juſt like lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, who not underſtanding the play at Cheſs, and ſeeing two excellent game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters play, would judge, to ſee the men here and there upon the board, that there were nothing there but diſorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe they do not underſtand how each hath reference to another, nor the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they are ſo placed, and as the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of theſe children doth not prove that the Cheſs-men are not well ordered, ſo, neither thoſe that will not acknowledge the wonderfull effects of Juſtice, goodneſs, wiſdom, and truth of God, which appeares in the confuſion, and diſorder of humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do by their incredulity, prove that they are not directed and guided by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and inperceptible wiſdom.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Mistakes, and Childiſh over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who, though he acknowledges a Deity, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies its Providence.</head>
               <p>THe Diſciples of <hi>Epicurus</hi> of theſe times, would not ſtick much to confeſſe, and grant, that there is a God, ſo that it were alſo granted them, that he doth not meddle with the Affaires of this World; for, that which leads them to this, is, the feare they have to be evill entreated by this Deity, if it takes any notice of their actions: but, becauſe they plainly ſee the coherence and indiſſoluble tie of theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> That if there is a God, he doth alſo take notice of the Affaires done in the World; and ſo reciprocally, if there is a Providence, that Providence is a God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Good, Juſt, and Wiſe, they not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to promiſe themſelves any good from this Deity; here they leave their Maſter, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny both God and Providence too. And, although that it may ſeeme here ſuperfluous to confute <hi>Epicurus</hi> opinion, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170457:40"/>a Deity, but no Providence, ſince, that in this point his Diſciples, which are now, do not follow him, nevertheleſs it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to ſhew in this very thing the puerile miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their Maſter, that it may appeare that they have no great reaſon to follow him in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, who in this miſtakes, and faulters ſo groſſely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epicurus</hi> then might juſtly be asked this queſtion, why, if there is a God, he doth not take notice of the things of this World? And, whether it is becauſe it is a thing too low, and vile, and unworthy his greatneſs and Majeſty, or, is it becauſe he cannot, or that he will not do it, becauſe it would diſturb his quiet and tranquility. There is no reaſon in either of theſe. And, as to the firſt, If there was in this World no order, but only a totall confuſion, and diſorder, it would not be reaſonable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to God and his conduct this diſorder and confuſion: but, this World (as well the great, as the little one) being (as we have ſhewed before) Governed with ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull order, and compoſed with ſuch a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Symmetry, which cannot proceed but from a Wiſdom altogether unſpeakable, is it a thing below the greatneſſe, wiſdom, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power of God, to have ſo admirably fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and compoſed all theſe things and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and keep them alwaies in this order? By
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170457:40"/>what is known the skil of an Artificer, but by the fair Compoſure &amp; greatneſſe of his worke: The work then of Creation and Providence being (as indeed they are) ſo great and ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, are they unworthy the Greatneſſe and wiſedom of God. And what can wee conceive greater or more wonderful, &amp; conſequently more worthy of him. And indeed the works of Redemption are yet far more admirable and full of a wiſdome, goodneſſe and power more conſpicuous, but hence it doth no waies follow, but that the works of Creation, and Providence are to be attributed to him eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Seeing that they are the Baſis and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the worke of Redemption, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Subject matter of it, for man ſhould not have been ſaved and redeemed unleſſe he had been firſt created, and unleſſe he was conducted and gnided by God in this World. Nor may it be here objected, that the Earth and mud, and a thouſand Excrements of Sea and Land, are things too vile and baſe to be handled, by ſo clean hands as thoſe of God, and to be an effect of his ſo mighty and glorious Power.</p>
               <p>For firſt, Is there not in the World things of a nobler and purer matter then thoſe, the Heavens and thoſe wonderfull Torches that ſhine in them, their Powers and Influences are they too low, vile, and abject things to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170457:41"/>be mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ged and governed by him, or to be produced by him? Let then theſe perſons find us out, and ſhew ſome matter more glorious, noble, and luminous. And as to thoſe vile things which they object to us, it would be indeed below the great Majeſty and purity of God, that they ſhould be created and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of this Eſſence, or that they ſhould make a part of it, and therefore they have not their Riſe from thence (they are made of nothing by his Almighty Power) neither make they any part of it. And if God had a Body, Hands, and Fingers, as wee have, one might rationally doubt whether it would be fit for him to touch with his moſt ſacred &amp; moſt pure hands, any matter ſo vile &amp; baſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is not beſeeming the Majeſty of a King to handle and remove the Earth and Mud as a Potter doth his Clay, or as a Groom the dung from a Stable: But being as he is, incorporeall, and altogether a ſpirit, his Eſſence is in ſo wiſe contaminated with theſe things, much leſſe is then the Sun and his Beames is ſoyled with the Dunghills and Carcaſſes upon which they act and diſperſe themſelves, much leſſe yet then the Soules Eſſence is tainted with this body which it animates, nor with its part and excrements which it moves and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitates by its Operation and Virtue.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:170457:41"/>
               <p>But, I will ask, Is vertue a thing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Gods cognizance and care, that he may recompenſe and reward it? contrariwiſe, what is there in the World more Noble, and more reſembling the Deity? In what is man ſo like to God, as in living holyly and vertuously? ſhall we eſteeme it a thing unbeſeeming God, to love, cheriſh, and reward vertue, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men; and conſequently, that he knowes, ſees, and takes care of them? what ſhall he love then, and to what ſhall he take pleaſure, unleſs he loves vertue, and thoſe that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after it? And, as for vice, and vicious men, doth not God hate them? yes certainly, unleſs we will transforme him in that wicked Principle of the <hi>Manichees</hi> and make of God a Devill; and hating vice and vitious men, ſhall we think that he leaves them unpuniſhed, and that he doth not care to ſhew by his chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his hatred of, and diſpleaſure againſt them; would not this be to make men believe, that vice and vertue are things indifferent to him, and that he cares for either alike. Briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Conduct, Government, and Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency of ſo many Peoples, Nations, States, Kingdomes, Common-wealths, and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, which are upon the face of the Earth, their Generation, their Succeſſion one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as well as the ſucceſſion of particular men) and the divers, and ſo admirable events,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170457:42"/>which are ſeen in them, and in which one may perceive ſo wonderfull a Wiſdom, even in their very diſorders (as we have ſhewed before) is it a thing too low, and vile, and unworthy the care, and intermedling of God? Who is it then ſhall do all theſe things, and to whom will this be better attributed? To hazard, and to blinde fortune? But, we have ſhewed, that ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an order, which markes out unto us a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wiſdom, cannot be the product, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a thing, ſo brutiſh and blinde as fate is. So then, it is evident, that it is not a thing unbefitting the greatneſs of God, to take upon him the care and Government of this World, but contrariwiſe, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more beſeeming his Wiſdom, Power, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee whether it is a thing that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or that he will not do. If God is, he muſt needs have ſubſiſted of all Eternity, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beginning. For, who ſhould have given him his being? He could not have created himſelfe, nor be made out of nothing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cauſe, and no firſt, or Superior cauſe can challenge the Creation of him, for there is nothing before, or ſuperior to God. And if he hath exiſted from all Eternity, he is then infinite, in reſpect of his duration. And if he hath an infinite duration, his Power is alſo infinite; and if he is infinitely Powerfull,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170457:42"/>this World, which (though very great) is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding finite, and is not ſo great, but that it can have been made, or created by him, or ruled and Governed by an infinite Power, ſuch as his is. Moreover, this God, which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus</hi> acknowledgeth, is not he to be placed above all the viſible Heavens? yes, for it would be below him, and his greatneſs, to place, or confine him within this Worlds compaſs, and amongſt viſible things. In whatſoever place then that we are upon the Earth either in this, or the other hemiſphere, as the Heavens do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way compaſs us about, ſo we muſt conceive, that God is above all theſe viſible Heavens, and not in ſome part of them onely. God then encloſes on every ſide all theſe Heavens above, where he is granted to be, and conſequently, although his Eſſence ſhould not extend it ſelf infinitely above them all, and that in the <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramundane</hi> ſpace there was ſome limits of his being (which is falſe, and contradicts the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of his Eſſence and Power) yet ſhould he be much greater then this viſible World, and ſo ſhould have alwayes Power and ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for to move, guide, and Govern this World. He wants then no Power to do this.</p>
               <p>Hath he then no minde to do it? yes, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hath, for why would not he Govern it, ſince he can do it? We have but juſt now
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170457:43"/>ſhewed, that it is not a thing below him, but rather much beſeeming, and worthy of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties care. Why then would not he Govern it, is it becauſe he hath no Right to it, or Power over it, and that being juſt, he will not encroach out his juriſdiction? Who then ſhall have Right and Authority over this World, unleſſe it be God. Shall we imagine with the <hi>Manichees,</hi> that there is another Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which hath this Right, or, that hath his ſhare in it? This would be to conſtitute two Gods, and albeit another had a ſhare in the Government of this VVorld (which is falſe, and impoſſible, yet God alwayes muſt have his part alſo) and ſo by this conceſſion, we muſt turn to the party of thoſe extravagant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Hereticks, with their two Principles, juſtling and fighting againſt one another, and one ſtill endeavouring to overcome the other. Seeing then that God hath Right and Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this VVorld, why would not he Govern it? Is it becauſe that would give him too much trouble, would perturbate his repoſe, and diminiſh his felicity? It is that indeed which <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſaith, but with what ground, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of reaſon? God being endowed with an infinite Power and VViſdom, cannot he without labor or paine Govern this World, ſince that ſo great as it is, yet it is ſtill infinitely below God. The heavens, and thoſe glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170457:43"/>that are fixed to them, are not wearied with turning alwayes above us, nor of acting by their influences in theſe ſublunary bodies, for the production of all things that are; and ſhall we believe that the Deity, which is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Almighty, and All-wiſe, ſhould toyle, or weary himſelfe in ſuſtaining, maintaining, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting, and governing this World, which is ſo ſmall, in compariſon of him, that it is leſſe then nothing. Men, in their thoughts, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, and deſigns, and in the deliberations they take, for the regulating, and managing of their Affaires, or thoſe of the publick, do weary themſelves, and thence grow ſad, and irkſome to their own ſelves (which perturbates their content) becauſe they are corporeal, and that the motions of their ſoules are made through the help of the organs of the body, which by the motion and agitation of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall ſpirits, do ſometimes ſtretch, raiſe, and bend themſelves too much, and ſo as it were they break, and ſplit themſelves, or elſe they weary and hurt themſelves, by being too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and intent on what they do; and theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits alſo diſſipate themſelves, ſo that they need an often reiterated reſt, to repaire the loſſe of theſe diſſipated ſpirits. But God being a pure Spirit, without any mixture of body or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is never weary in his thoughts, purpoſes, and deſignes, neither doth he diſcourſe after
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170457:44"/>the manner of men, drawing a concluſion from the Premiſes, neither doth he think of one thing, and then of another, for there is not in him (I meane in his wiſdom and intelligence, no more then in the Eternity of his duration) neither firſt nor ſecond <hi>prius &amp; poſterius,</hi> but all theſe thoughts, deſigns, counſells, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, are in him but one ſingle and pure act, by which he ſees, knowes, underſtands, wills, and ordereth all things; his moſt pure, and perfect ſimplicity (which agreeth with ſo excellent and infinite a Nature) requireth that, and it implies a contradiction, that there ſhould be in his Eſſence any variableneſſe, or ſhadow of turning; we do conceive the Eſſence of God, his vertues, and properties, his wiſdom, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, underſtanding, his will, that is to ſay, his Counſells, and deſigns, as by ſo many images, formes, and diſtinct conceptions, becauſe that being corporeall, and finite, and he a Spirit, altogether infinite, we cannot ſee, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what God is in himſelfe, but we know well nevertheleſſe, that Gods perfection, and ſimplicity doth not admit of ſo many things wholly different one from another; neither doth it imply that they be in his Eſſence <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter</hi> (as the Scholemen ſay) but <hi>eminenter, &amp; cauſaliter,</hi> as we hold that the Sun is not in his ſubſtance and Eſſence hot as the fire is, but only as he is the cauſe of heat every where.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170457:44"/>It is then a very low thought of God, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that he labours in thinking, or deſigning any thing, or that he wearies himſelfe in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from thence, that he growes melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, and ſad, and that this troubles his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and content, and in ſome manner abates from his felicity.</p>
               <p>Whence then did proceed this Philoſophers ſo low and baſe thought and imagination, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy his great parts. It ſeemes to me indeed, that it was rather an evaſion, then any certain and fixed opinion of his. That is, that he not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (as I have ſaid before) to deny flatly and plainly all manner of Deities, for feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecuted, hated, and deteſted by the World, laught at, hiſſed, and neglected by honeſt men, and men of parts, he hath yielded to the commonly received opinion concerning the Deity, but hath debarred him from any knowledge of, or care for the World, which is that which all his Diſciples and followers would have granted to them. And when he was asked, why he denied that the Deity had any ſuch knowledge, or care, he hath waved this queſtion, by this evaſion, that then God would have too much trouble upon him, and that it would diſquiet him, and would ſomething diminiſh of his happineſs and tranquility, And when it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to him, that then it is a vaine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170457:45"/>thing to ſerve and honour this Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that he might not ſeeme altogether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, in granting, that Gods ſervice is ſuperfluous, and unprofitable, he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded this queſtion, by ſaying, that although we receive nothing from the Deity for all the ſervice we do him, yet it is to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and adored, as being in it ſelfe moſt glorious and excellent, and as ſuch it ought to be honoured and adored by us, as we honour, and have in great eſteeme, thoſe Kings and Princes that are ſtrangers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we do not expect any reward from them, nor feare their puniſhments. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, to give ſome colour to his Witty, but prophane anſwer, he hath built many ſublime ſpeculations of the excellency of the nature of God, of his immutability, of his perfection, that he needeth nothing out of himſelfe, having in himſelfe all manner of perfections, which make him perfectly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and contented. And, becauſe quiet and tranquility of ſpirit doth conduce much to, yea, doth almoſt wholly make up the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man, he would in no way deprive God of it, but hath exalted it highly both in God and in men, and held that this ſaid tranquility conſiſted in vertue, and in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thereof, and hath enlarged upon theſe Noble ſpeculations much more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170457:45"/>of thoſe heathen Philoſophers that were before him: and by theſe he hath got both the admiration and commendation of men; and all this was, that his opinion might be received, and paſs for currant amongſt the refinedſt wits: But all this was, that he might eſtabliſh his aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath neither care nor knowledge of humane things, as not having need himſelfe for the perfecting of his happineſs, of contentment and tranquility, or the enjoyment of any of theſe viſible things, without which he may very well be, and the care and Government of which would rather be a care and tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, then any pleaſure and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now it is very true that God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yea, much more perfect then ever this man believed him to be, and that for his happineſs and perfection he hath no need of any Terreſtriall, Worldly, and viſible things, and that he was very well without them in an infinite number of ages, before the World began. Neither hath he created all theſe for any need that he had of them, or that by them he might add ſomething to his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but incited by his own goodneſs, that he might communicate out of himſelfe, as much as might be his goodneſs, vertues, and perfections.</p>
               <p>Which is an argument of his perfection,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170457:46"/>to be not only good and happy in himſelf, but alſo to be willing to do good to others, in communicating to them ſomething of his goodneſs and perfections. We ſee a ſhadow and image of this in thoſe perſons which are vertuous and liberall, who, not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be rich, and to abound themſelves, do communicate to others as much as in them lieth of their vertues and riches, which all naturally do eſteem to be a great perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
               <p>This great, but profane Philoſopher, hath not conſidered, or at leaſt would not do it, that this, (<hi>viz.</hi> Communication) being a vertue moſt commendable in man, he was not to alienate it from God, but attribute it to him as a quality and property moſt conſonant to the excellency of his nature, and from thence he was to conclude, that this World was the production and workmanſhip of God, (according to this his propriety) and that he had in his hands the ruling and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; being it is in no wiſe rationall, that the Creation, Subſiſtence, Preſervation, Conduct and Adminiſtration of ſo admirable a piece of workmanſhip, ſhould properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to any other but him.</p>
               <p>And albeit ſome will ſay in his favour, that it was ſo farr from him to be an enemy to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and a friend to vice, that he hath extolled
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170457:46"/>it the moſt of any, and hath made it to ſeem more glorious then ever it was thought ſhe was before; that which he hath done, was in effect nothing elſe then to make a vaile to cover his profaneneſſe, and by his doing ſo, make his poyſon to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down with more eaſe, by the fine wits which he hath entangled and caught by his diſcourſes: for this ſpot and ſtaine will never be taken away, <hi>viz.</hi> That he taught that we muſt not hope any thing from God, or feare him who did not meddle with any thing we have to do in this World. By which doctrine he doth cry down Prayer, Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Thankſgiving to the Deity (which is the very heart and marrow of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Piety) yea, the very feare and reſpect, and love which we owe to God. For, what feare, and reſpect, and love, can we have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Deity, which, by their tenents we cannot know, becauſe it hath neither made the World, nor Governs it and which hath no commerce with Man; there being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to come to the knowledge of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then either the conſideration of the World, and of the works of God in it, or the Revelation that he may make to us of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in his own Word. And therefore, all that <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his followers can ſay, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Service and Honour due to God, is in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170457:47"/>effect, nothing but a ſlight evaſion which they framed, that they might avoid the envy and hatred of men againſt their impiety, at which cults and ſervices (as in no wiſe agreeing to their maxims) they did laugh within themſelves, as <hi>Cicero</hi> doth report, that the ancient <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs</hi> did laugh among themſelves at their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Auſpicia,</hi> though they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to the ſimple people as a Divine thing.</p>
               <p>Which the Diſciples of <hi>Epicurus</hi> have veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſufficiently by their practiſe, in which there was little or no reſpect rendered by them to the Deity, witneſſe a Latin Poet in theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The ſixth <hi>Argument,</hi> Drawn from the Immortality of the ſoule.</head>
               <p>THoſe that do deny a Deity, do alſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deny that there is another life after this, and that mans ſoule is immortall, and will acknowledge neither Paradiſe, nor Hell, nor Angells, nor Devills, and theſe things indeed are ſo firmely conjoyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that whoſoever denyeth, or affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth one of them, ought alſo to affirm, or deny the reſt. So that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who denyed that there was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angell, Spirit, or Reſurrection, were in effect right <hi>Epicures,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> like thoſe of theſe times, who for the feare of the Lawes, and ſhame of the World, not daring openly to ſay what they think, make an outward Profeſsion of the Religion which is Publiquely received in the Land or State, of which they are members, though they really believe nothing of it, but laugh and gibe at it ſecretly, and hold it to be a meere tale.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:170457:48"/>
               <p>The Reaſon of this impiety and Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is that which we have noted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe perſons are wholy ſenſuall and carnall, bewitched with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and ſweets of this World, in which they conſtitute their ſupream good &amp; happineſſe; which is that that makes them to hold for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles all that is ſaid of another Life after this, and the Happineſſe and Miſery which attends men there. They hold alſo that the Soule dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and periſheth with the Body, neither will they acknowledge that there are any Angells or Devills, that ſo they may not be forced to confeſſe that the Soule is immortall, and that there is an Eternall puniſhment of the wicked after this Life, and by this means they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alſo the Deity and his Providence. For they plainly perceive that if there is a God, he is a juſt Judge, and a Revenger of the ſins and iniquities of men, and that the God of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus</hi> is in effect nothing but an Idoll and a vain imagination. From the Deity they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect or promiſe to themſelves any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; ſince that they do not love and cheriſh Virtue, but only deſire to ſatisfie their evill Concupiſcences in which they think the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum</hi> is contained, which is that, that makes them to deny the Deity, the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soule, and another Life where there is a Hell, and a Paradiſe, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170457:48"/>telling them, that they cannot have a part in the Paradiſe, and that Hell, if there is any, is for them and their like.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, if the Soule is immortall there is another Life, and in it a place of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or ſorrow for man, there are alſo Angels Copartners of this Joy, and Devills the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of theſe Supplices, and above all, a God who doth juſtly reward the one, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the other: For if the Soule is immortall being, as it is, naturally very active, it cannot be alwaies without any ſentiment, and remain ſo forever, for that would be little leſſe then death, it muſt needs then follow that it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates of ſome joy and content, or that it is tormented and hath an infinite ſhare of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and that for the Reward of that good or evill, vice or virtue, to which it hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in this Life; for we have ſhewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore that Virtue is worthy of Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reward, and Vice of ſhame and of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Which not being ſufficiently according to their merits rewarded in this Life; it muſt needs be rewarded in the other: otherwiſe both vice &amp; virtue ſhould be deprived of their due, which is againſt Nature and Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And this is to grant a Paradiſe and a Hell. And if the Soule is immortall, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to deny that there are Angells and Devills; ſince either of them are immateriall, ſpirituall
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170457:49"/>and incorporeall ſubſtances. And indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing makes theſe men to deny that there are Angells, and Devills, but that if they grant this, they muſt alſo confeſſe, that the ſoule is immortall, and ſo that there is a Heaven and a Hell, which is that which they ſo much feare and tremble at.</p>
               <p>Now it may be proved, both by teſtimony and by reaſon, that the ſoule is immortall, by the Teſtimony, I ſay, of all men, that are, or have ever been upon the face of the Earth; for, if the records of Antiquity be looked into, and Hiſtory, both Ancient and Modern be read, it will be found that there never was yet, neither at this day is there any People, or Nation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther civiliz'd or not, which doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the ſoule of man doth ſubſiſt, and lives after the death of the body: but of the ſtrength of this proofe we will ſpeak hereafter; as for the arguments that prove the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soule, they cannot be <hi>a priori,</hi> for there is none but God that is the cauſe of it, whoſe exiſtency we are now about to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Theſe arguments then muſt be taken <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> and we muſt prove this immortality by the effects of the Soule, and indeed they are ſuch effects, ſo great and admirable, as cannot proceed from a mortall and materiall cauſe; Now its effects and operations are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internall in the ſoule it ſelfe (and thoſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170457:49"/>either in the Intellect, as Knowledge, or in the Will, as the Virtues) or externall, as the Speech and the motions of the body, and the parts of it, whence doe proceed the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and ſtupendious works of liberall, and mechanicall arts. In all the things that are ſeen in this great World there are ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the excellency of things, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above the other, by which, as by ſo many Ladders, we aſcend at laſt to the knowledge of immateriall and eternall things, the lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of theſe is of inſenſible things, that have neither Life nor Motion, as Stones, Metalls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond is of thoſe that have ſome life by which they grow, and are nouriſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The third is of thoſe, that beſides this kind of life have a ſenſitive facultie, and locall motion by which they are carried from one place to another, as all the Animalls. Amongſt which there are ſeverall degrees of perfection. For there are ſome of them that have only the ſenſe of feeling, as Oyſters; ſome, beſides the ſenſe of feeling, have the ſenſe of taſting alſo, as Bees, and many other Inſects: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again have the ſenſes of ſmelling and hearing, as the Moles or Wants. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, theſe are the moſt perfect Animalls, which have the five externall ſenſes, and among theſe there are ſome that excell in one ſence, ſome in another: as the Eagles, which have a very quick
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170457:50"/>and ſharp ſight, and the Vultures, Wolves, and Dogs have a very exqiſite faculty of ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Theſe Senſes do receive in them the <hi>Spcies</hi> and <hi>Ideas</hi> of the materiall qualities that are inherent in their Subjects, from theſe ſenſes they are afterwards conveyed to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination or common ſence, which receiveth them, and from which doth ſtraightwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the knowledge of the things themſelves. By this Knowledge they are induced to hate, or fly from; to love, or purſue after theſe very things, and to move towards, or remove from them. But all this Knowledge, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth and is ſeated in the Imagination, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſingular and individuall things, and they are alſo materiall, becauſe the qualities, which are the Objects of the ſenſes, are all materiall, and have quantity for their Subject and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Above all this is man endowed with Reaſon, of which all other Animalls are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, and by which he doeth things much more wonderfull then they altogether can. For by it he knowes not only ſingular, individuall, and immateriall things, but alſo thoſe that are univerſall: And by it he diſcourſes, makes Arguments, drawes and deduces one thing from another, doth dive into the Nature of things, and ſeekes after their Cauſes from whence the Sciences are raiſed, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Philoſophy and of all its parts is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170457:50"/>to: to which we can find nothing like among the other Animalls. By this ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he abſtracts quantity from matter (by a mentall abſtraction) be it either <hi>Quantit as Concreta</hi> or <hi>Diſcreta,</hi> as they terme it, <hi>Viz.</hi> Numbers, Superficies, Geometricall Bodies, and doth conſider their ſever all kinds, figures, qualities, properties, proportions analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, &amp;c. from whence do proceed the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſciences ſo wonderfull in all their kinds, whether they be ſimple and abſolute, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick and Geometry; or compound, as Aſtronomy, Opticks, Muſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the knowledge of which proceed ſo wonderfull effects, that they even raviſh out of themſelves the very Artiſts in thoſe Sciences. By this ſame Reaſon man doth conſider the time and place, and all things that are done in them, and not only thoſe that are preſent; or that are done, or happen before his eyes, but alſo thoſe things that are paſt, which he doth keep in his Memory, &amp; keeps a Regiſter of them; &amp; often judges of thoſe things that are to come, which he doth often fore-ſee by a Morall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, he knowes alſo the place, not only of his Birth, and where he dwelleth, <hi>viz.</hi> his houſe, and that which is round about it, but alſo all the Country round about, even of all the world ſo great as it is; for he conceiveth it in his mind, and gets a certain &amp; true <hi>Idea</hi> of it,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170457:51"/>and by the means of all theſe things he acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſo exquiſite a wiſdome and prudence, that he is known to be admirable, not only in the adminiſtration of his houſhold affairs, but alſo of thoſe of entire Corporations, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalties, Cities, States, Common-wealths, Kingdomes and Monarchies: to which there is nothing like in any other of the Animalls.</p>
               <p>By this ſame Reaſon man comprehendeth that which is infinite; conceiving in his mind that which hath no limits, either in reſpect of quantity, time or place: for he apprehendeth that there is not ſo great a number, but may be made greater, and that to the infinite: And that there is neither line, ſuperficies, body, or place ſo great, but that it may be extended further, and that infinitely.</p>
               <p>And that there is neither time, nor durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great length; but that it may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved infinite, either in regard of that which was before, or which is to follow after. And ſo in ſome ſort he comprehends Eternity and Immenſity, which could not be, unleſſe his Soule was in ſome Reſpect infinite, at leaſt in reſpect of its duration, that is to ſay, unleſſe it was indeed mortall, and immateriall.</p>
               <p>Finally, By this ſame Reaſon, man concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and comprehendeth the things immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as Spirits and Intelligences, and even the Deity it ſelfe, and doth conſider their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170457:51"/>qualities, virtues, aftections, and actions, and reflecting upon its own ſelf, and by her proper actions and operations, ſhe knowes and judges that ſhe is, and ought to be Immortall, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall, and ſpirituall, which could not be effected by her, unleſſe that in deed ſhe was ſuch. By this Reaſon man is capable of Virtue, which is its owne effect produced in its Will; by which Virtue man doth chiefly appear to be more excellent then Brutes, and comes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Deity, of which Virtue is a lively Image. Virtue, which is praiſed and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by men, and by the Deity it ſelfe, to which is moſt juſtly due that Recompenſe and Reward, which is but ſeldome paid to her in this Life. For who knows not, that the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and virtuous men are often deſpiſed and of no Eſteem, and commonly hated, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and tormented by the reſt of men: Which is the cauſe, that many Heathen of old, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how unjuſtly and ill Virtue was entreated, and not being able to comprehend how a wiſe and juſt Providence could or ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this, have rather denyed the Providence, and committed the managing of humane affairs to chance and fortune, then to tax the Deity of this Errour, which (they thought) could not be avoided, if this Providence had any thing to do in this World. Whereas they ſhould have rather acknowledged the Immortality of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170457:52"/>Soule, and that there is another Life then this, in which man is to receive that juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe due to his works, which is more conformable to Reaſon, then to deny the Providence and Deity. This Virtue then which is ſo excellent, and which doth in ſome ſort Deifie men, and is by all acknowledged to be ſuch, cannot be an effect or production of a groſſe and corruptible matter, but rather of a ſpirituall and immortall Eſſence. As to the Effects of reaſon, which ſhew themſelves exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and out the Soule, there is firſt the Speech, by which man expreſſeth his Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, Paſſions, and Affections, and makes it ſelfe to be underſtood by others, which ſpeech is a proper and incommunicable Effect. And this faculty is found to be in no other then in man, ſo that the Jewiſh Philoſophers have alwaies defined a Rationall Animall to be a <hi>Speaking Animall:</hi> for though ſome Birds may be taught to ſpeak, their Speech is nothing but a brutiſh imitation, void and deſtitute of all Reaſon, and which is in no waies guided by it: and though ſome Animalls have a voice by which they expreſſe their deſire, and internall motions, that comes nothing near the ſpeech of man, by which he expreſſeth ſo diſtinctly, and in every particular all his Conceptions: therefore the voice of Brutes is an effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a much inferiour Cauſe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170457:52"/>of another Nature, then that from which proceeds the ſpeech of man.</p>
               <p>The motions of mans body and of all its parts which proceed from the Will, and are guided by Reaſon, are ſuch, ſo various, and wonderfull in reſpect of thoſe of Beaſts, that they give a plain evidence that the Body of man, ſo artificially made and fitted to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny motions, is the dwelling of a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gueſt, then that which carryes and moves the body of Beaſts: for theſe admirable works and effects of both Liberall and Mechanicall Arts being ſeriouſly conſidered, do argue a cauſe altogether ſpirituall and divine, and are not the Effects of a corruptible matter. For, I pray, for example, what wonderfull thing is <hi>Writing,</hi> which with ſo few Characters doth expreſſe an infinite number of words ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which ſerve not only for every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Langnage, but for every Tongue under Heaven? And what a wonder is it, that the Hands and Fingers are ſo artificially made and fitted to infinite forts of Motions neceſſary for the Exerciſe of all the Arts, and for the working of all thoſe things that are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner infinite? In which thing we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a wiſdome altogether divine, which hath ſo wiſely framed this humane Body, and grant that there is an immortall and ſpirituall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which directs and guides all theſe ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170457:53"/>and almoſt infinite motions. Time would be wanting to any that would decipher the Wonders and Excellencies of Limning, Sculpture, Muſick, and of all other Arts, both Liberall and Mechanicall, the effects of which are ſo admirable, that man wonders at his own ſelfe, and is almoſt ſwallowed up with the admiration of his works. By all that hath been ſaid, it is eaſie to ſee what an infinite diſtance there is between the Soule of Man and that of Beaſts, ſince the effects of both are ſo divers, and that there is no Reaſon to ſay that the one as well as the other is materiall, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, or mortall. Thoſe that have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and collected the various effects of the imaginative faculty of Brutes, of their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and fore-ſight of things, of ſome appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Virtue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they might make them run parallell with thoſe which proceed from mans Reaſon, to ſhew by this, that the Soule of the one is not of another Nature then the Soule of the other; and that bring for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, the quickneſſe and vivacity of the Apes and Elephants, and their aptneſſe to be taught to do any thing one would have them to do; Alſo the Labour and Induſtry of Bees, by which they frame their Lodges, and make the Wax and Honey; The Oeconomy and fore-ſight of Amets, the chaſtity of Doves, and Turtles, the watchfullneſs, order, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170457:53"/>of Cranes, (ſuch as is the Author of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue intituled <hi>Brother Anſelme,</hi> where he brings an Aſſe diſputing againſt this Monke, and proving to him, that all the advantages, priviledges, prerogatives, and excellencies, that man pretends to have above beaſts, are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if not ſurpaſſed, by all thoſe things that we ſee of their nature) ſuch perſons I ſay have not ſaid or written theſe things ſeriouſly, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhew the vivacity of their wit, and the Knowledge that they had of the Nature of brutes, or if they have done it ſeriouſly &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately, and on purpoſe to make good the Mortality of the Soule, and to plead the Atheiſts Cauſe (as it ſeemeth that this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Author hath done, becauſe that after he hath pleaded at large the Cauſe of Beaſts againſt man, and ingeniouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, as he thinks, all the arguments that can be brought to prove its excellency above that of beaſts, at laſt he yeelds, and flies to one argument taken from the death of the Son of God, which he hath ſuffered only for man, and to which the beaſts have no part: an argument very ſtrong, but which is of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue among Atheiſts, and prophane perſons, and at which they laugh in themſelves, as being fooliſh and ridiculous) theſe I ſay ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this to be more brutiſh and ignorant then this Aſſe, which they make to diſpute ſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170457:54"/>ſubtilely: there being in effect no compariſon betwixt theſe pretended wonders and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of beaſts, and thoſe which are really ſeen in man; which in this goes infinitely beyond them, and in reſpect of which all the reſt are as a phantaſme, or meer nothing.</p>

               <p>It is a certain thing, and dayly experience teacheth us, and the Records of Antiquity do witneſſe, that every man (unleſſe he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together barbarous and brutiſh) hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the good and evill that he doeth. For he knowes very well, when he hath done well or ill: and if he hath done ill, his Conſcience accuſeth him, and if he hath committed any enormous crimes, his Conſcience doth affright him, and gives him no reſt, but doth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally torment him, fills his ſoule with anguiſh, and ſometimes, yea very often, doth caſt him into deſpaire. Of the truth of this no one can doubt, ſince Hiſtory is altogether full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the like nature. Theſe be the <hi>Furies</hi> of the Heathen Poets, who with their whips, ſcorpions, and torches, do inceſſantly purſue and torment the wicked, and this is no other but
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170457:54"/>
                  <hi>Prometheus's</hi> Vulture, which doth conſtantly gnaw mans heart, and the <hi>Worm that dieth not,</hi> which is mentioned in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Theſe fears and terrours do not proceed from the ſear of the puniſhment that men may inflict upon them, and thoſe men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are perplexed with them, which fear nothing from men, as the Tyrants, and other wicked men, and all thoſe that are in great Authority among men, as <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>Sicily,</hi> made his great favourite to acknowledge this, by hanging a ſword juſt over his head; and <hi>Caligula</hi> alſo, who did hide himſelfe under his bed-clothes whenſoever he heard the thunder. And that which is to be much noted is this, that very often they are then more affrightned by alarums of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; when they are near their end, and have as it were one foot in the grave, and have no reaſon to feare any thing from mens part, all which is a clear evidence that they dread another Judge, and fear ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſhment, and that they acknowledge there is another life then this, in which there is ſomething to be feared, or hoped for. It is a poor and ſimple evaſion to ſay, or imagine, that theſe fears and terrours proceed from a falſe opinion that men are perſwaded to, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is another life; for, if this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſalſe, and without any foundation,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170457:55"/>how can it be ſo prevalent over mens ſpirits, as that (for what they can do) they cannot be perſwaded to the contrary, though (I ſay) they do with all their hearts deſire that it were falſe.</p>
               <p>It is a very eaſie thing to perſwade our ſelves with that which we deſire, but it is not eaſie to perſwade a thing, which is wholly contrary to that which we deſire and wiſh, and eſpecially to perſwade it univerſally, to all, without any exception; for, whoſe Authority at any time might have been ſo great, as to make us believe this without any reaſon? or, who ſhould have been ſo very ſubtile, as to back this with reaſons, which deceive all the World, and even thoſe that deſire to diſcover the falſity of them? and how is it, that, if the opinion of the Atheiſts is true in this, and their reaſons and arguments ſo good and ſolid, they do not make all the World believe them, and do not ſhow clearly how vaine is the contrary opinion, and the reaſons for it: for though they make ſome believe it, they be ſuch as have overwhelmed and drowned their reaſon in carnall delights and pleaſures, and who are like a Malefactor, who makes himſelfe drunk in the priſon, whileſt the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is pronouncing againſt him. But all their reaſon and ſubtileneſs will never perſwade it to thoſe that are perplexed, and tormented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves by the guilt of their crimes, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170457:55"/>they themſelves very often are not free from the ſcourges of theſe Furies, which in ſpite of them do ſometimes give them terrible checks, which is an invincible argument of this great truth, naturally imprinted in the hearts of men, that there is a juſt Judge, and a ſevere Revenger of their ſins, which he never leaves unpuniſhed. It is alſo a poor evaſion to ſay, that ſuch are not bred in the Schole of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> whoſe followers and diſciples laugh at theſe phantaſmes and <hi>Chimeras.</hi> For firſt, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſheweth, that they themſelves are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from theſe terrours of conſcience: and (I think) they will grant <hi>Caligula,</hi> and ſuch like Monſters were of their tribe, who yet have felt theſe compunctions and terrors.</p>
               <p>Secondly, every one, through the corruption of his Nature, and his ſtrong inclinations to evill is to himſelfe a Maſter of <hi>Epicuriſm,</hi> and a profeſſor of Atheiſm, and would (if he could) perſwade this to himſelfe, that ſo he might with more freedom let the reins looſe to all his paſſions. And though it may be thoſe that have theſe alarums and terrours, are not open and profeſſed Atheiſts, yet they are ſo in their will and deſires, and nevertheleſs they cannot do ſo much as to free themſelves from theſe fears, and to looſe the opinion they have of a Deity, and of a Providence which will avenge it ſelf of their crimes, which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170457:56"/>doubtleſſe they could eaſily do, ſince they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire and endeavour after it, if this opinion was falſe and vaine, and did proceed from nothing but from a vaine inſtitution, or the phanſy of ſome that ſhould at firſt have taught it. And it is much to be wondered at, if the opinion of the Atheiſts be true, how thoſe that have rid Common wealths of Tyrants, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, have been commended by all, have had their Statues erected, and <hi>Panegyricks</hi> have been compoſed to praiſe them, and extoll them unto Heaven; whereas, if <hi>Epicurus</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> or <hi>Lucretius</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> had aſcended the Theatre, to perſwade men to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to free them from theſe Tyrannicall, inſulting, and by them pretended Panicall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Conſcience, which do perplex and torment the ſoules of men; inſtead of being applauded, they had been ſtoned, and brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the execrations and curſe of every one.</p>
               <p>And although all thoſe that are laden with vices, and enormous crimes, are not vexed, or tormented by theſe Furies, yet this is not an argument to evince, that therefore theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are vaine (no more then becauſe all here below do not receive the juſt puniſhment due to their crimes, is an argument that there is no Providence that taketh notice of them) but is rather a clear evidence of the ſottiſhneſs
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170457:56"/>and brutiſhneſs of men, which drown their reaſon in the torrent of their vices: and the remorſes and worme of conſcience in the reſt, are ſure proofes and effects of the Deity, which never leaves it ſelf without a witneſs in man, whoſe conſcience is his own accuſer, witneſs, judge, and executioner altogether.</p>
               <p>If man knowes, and is certain of the evill that he doth, and if his conſcience accuſes and affrights him, he knowes alſo, and is very certain of the good he doth: and that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he hath of his innocency, and good life, doth cauſe in him a great reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a wonderfull tranquillity of minde, which he values and eſteemes more, and which makes him more happy and content then wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are with the enjoyment of all their goods, honors, pleaſures, and riches. And of this felicity and content, which honeſt men do partake of more then the wicked men, the writings of heathen Philoſophers themſelves are full, without excepting even <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who hath been forced to acknowledge this truth, which is a ſtrong argument, that vertue hath a more reall and nobler recompenſe in it ſelfe, then that happineſs which is pretended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the goods, honours, pleaſures of this life; and that it carries along with it ſelfe its own reward, and expects another ſomewhere elſe then in this life (and that cannot be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170457:57"/>the praiſe and eſteem of men, and the poſterities romembrance of their good works, becauſe moſt commonly vertue and vertuous men are deprived of this) which ſhewes unto us its excellency above vice, and an infinite diſtance between her and evill. Moreover, when men are wrongfully and unjuſtly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, their goods, life, and laudable actions calumniated, and their perſons abuſed and diffamed, they juſtifie and defend themſelves as much as they can, and paſſionately and vehemently endeavour to prove their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; and this very thing do the Atheiſts, againſt whom we diſpute, if they are at any time calumniated, or blamed without a cauſe. Why this, I pray, unleſſe there was a vaſt difference between good and evill, vice and vertue, unleſſe the one was worthy of praiſe, the other of diſgraces; the one of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other of reward? I ſay, what need they care to be praiſed, or vilified, if theſe praiſes, or diſgraces are in effect but imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things, without any reall ground, and if all this doth confiſt but meerly in fancy and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>Theſe pretended ſtrong wits ſhould laugh at all the ill opinion that men can have of them for their crimes, and ſhould not put themſelves to the trouble of making any Apologies then when they are wrongfully accuſed, for why
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170457:57"/>ſhould one trouble himſelf for a falſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hath no real and ſolid foundation? And this is an Argument to prove, that thoſe men, maugre themſelves, are forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, even againſt their own Maxims, what a vaſt difference there is between good and evill, vice and virtue, the recompenſe due to the one, and the puniſhments which the other doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p>Again, experience teacheth us, that when men are violently and unjuſtly oppreſſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any means or hopes to revenge themſelves, they have recourſe to the Deity, from whoſe Juſtice they expect and promiſe to themſelves the revenge of that wrong which is done to them. Which <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth remark very well in his <hi>Apologetick</hi> againſt the Heathen, and ſaith, that if any one of them was oppreſſed, he did cry out, <hi>Deus videt &amp; Deus reddet;</hi> God ſees, and God will render it: and that in ſaying ſo, he did not look towards the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitoll, where was the Temple of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> but toward Gods Throne; and he adds, that it is an evidence of a Soul really Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>For, this motion doth not proceed from a preconceived opinion of a Deity, which hath been imprinted in a mans ſoul by education: but which proceeds from his conſcience, and from the bottom of his heart, and from the judgement of his beſt and pureſt reaſon.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170457:58"/>which dictates, and ſuggeſts to him, yea, makes him in effect to acknowledge, that there is a Deity and Providence, which ſeeth from above the wrongs that are done here below, and takes notice of them to the end that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, and innocence defended. For it would be a poor refuge, and a ſmall comfort, to have then, and in ſuch a caſe, recourſe unto a falſe perſwaſion, which ſhould have no other foundation then the authority and inſtitution of a man, that ſhould have invented, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for currant ſo groſs a falſhood, ſuch as the Atheiſts would have the opinion of the Deity to be. It is true indeed, that in things where we have no intereſt, we are ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by thoſe perſons that are eminent, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in learning, or Authority, and do believe things, the falſhood of which we cannot eaſily diſcover: but in thoſe things that do ſo nearly relate to us, that are ſo important, and that do excite in us ſo violent motions and paſſions, we do not reſt upon thoſe perſwaſions, that have ſo groundleſs a foundation.</p>
               <p>By all this it doth appear, that man hath not only an acquired, but alſo a naturall knowledge of the Deity and Providence, and of the reall and eſſentiall difference there is between good and evill, vice and virtue; his own conſcience and reaſon dictating and perſwading him both the one and the other.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:170457:58"/>
               <p>Again, experience ſhews us, that man hath a natural knowledge, and reſentment of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and his Providence: for, when he is ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in a moment by a manifeſt, evident, and unavoidable danger of death; as if a bouſe falls upon him in an inſtant, or that he ſall into a precipice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he lifts up preſently his heart and minde towards Heaven, and in this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and diſtreſs, hath his recourſe to the Deity, and prays unto it, that it would aid and ſuccour him, and caſts himſelf in the arms of his protection, as a child doth in the arms of his father.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the firmneſs, conſtancy, and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of minde of the truly-faithfull, and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when they did depart from this World; as alſo the conſtancy of the holy Martyrs of the Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and the hope, which they have of a better life, is an evident teſtimony of this truth. For then, and in that place, it is not a time to ſooth ones ſelf, and feed ones hopes with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. And how could the imagination of a meer <hi>Chimara</hi> cauſe in them ſo wonderfull a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo great tranquillity of minde? If the perſwaſion of a Deity did meerly proceed from Inſtitution, and Authority, which ſhould make us believe it without any ground of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it would not doubtleſs make ſo deep an impreſſion in our Souls, and would quickly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh of it ſelf at deaths encounter.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. X</hi> The eighth Reaſon, drawn from <hi>Wizards, Magicians, Enchantours,</hi> and from all the <hi>Heathens</hi> Idolatry and Superſtition.</head>
               <p>IT is a certain thing, which the experience of our days, and that of all ages doth averr, which the Monuments of Hiſtory, both antient and modern, confirm, and that the Writings, as well of <hi>Heathens</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> certifie; That there are, and have been at all times in the World, <hi>Witches, Magicians, Diviners, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantours,</hi> and ſuch like notoriouſly-wicked people; that have a familiar communication, and a frequent commerce with the Devils: by whoſe help &amp; power they do many ſtrange and prodigious things, above and beyond all human wiſdome. All which conſequently doth inferr, that theſe things proceed from a ſupernatural, and immaterial cauſe; ſuch as the <hi>Daemons</hi> be.</p>
               <p>The Laws made, and promulgated in all wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed States and Common-wealths, as well that of the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as thoſe of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> and of the Heathens themſelves, do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this to us. The executions and ſupplices, which juſtice doth frequently inflict upon ſuch perſons; their Proceſſes; the Relations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, that are made about them, do aſſure as of this, and leave no doubt of it. The damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170457:59"/>curioſity of many perſons, which every day have recourſe to ſuch as they, to know, ſee, and do thoſe things, that cannot be done by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means, doth alſo confirm this. The writings of the Heathens, as well <hi>Greeks</hi> as <hi>Romans,</hi> are full of inſtances of ſuch perſons, and of their effects, which are ſtupendious and wonderfull. So that a man muſt wholly renounce his reaſon, and believe nothing of thoſe things that are done, if he will not alſo believe that there are ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; which is true and manifeſt by all thoſe kinds of Teſtimonies, and Monuments, which may induce us to believe any thing.</p>
               <p>Now, if there are any <hi>Witches, Enchantours,</hi> &amp;c. it neceſſarily followes, that there are <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> by whoſe help and power they cauſe theſe prodigious effects to come to paſs, which men do wonder at, and look upon with horrour and amazement; it being not poſſible, that theſe things ſhould be done by any humane Power. The Hiſtories therefore, and writings of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and even of the Heathen themſelves, are full of examples of the Devils apparitions, and of their ſtrange effects.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sybills,</hi> ſo much taken notice of among the Heathen, are a clear teſtimony of this; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Predictions could not proceed but from a Deity, or from ſome <hi>Daemon</hi> that did poſseſs them. Now, if there are any <hi>Daemons,</hi> (as cannot be denied) <hi>it</hi> followes, that there is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170457:60"/>a Deity above them, which doth reſtrain them ſo, as that they ſhall not overthrow all things by their might: for they have ſtrength and malice enough to do it.</p>
               <p>The Sacred and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, which is in this conformable to dayly experience, teacheth us, that there have been in former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and that there are now perſons poſſeſſed by Devils; which is evident, and clear, and plainly appeareth by the ſtrange effects, which proceed from them. This ſame Sacred Hiſtory lets us know, that there have been <hi>Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Enchantours;</hi> as it appears by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> by the Hiſtory of <hi>Saul,</hi> who went to conſult with a woman who had a Familiar ſpirit; and by that of the maid, of whom mention is made in the book of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> But of the truth recorded in theſe Sacred writings ſomething may be ſpoken hereafter.</p>
               <p>The books, which ſince have been written of theſe Diabolical and Magical Arts, and which are to be got too eaſily, even among <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whoſe damnable curioſityleads them to this: The publique profeſſion of ſuch Magical Arts, which hath been ſometimes tolerated in ſome of the moſt ſamous Univerſities of <hi>Christendom,</hi> to the great diſhonour of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſtinction of <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white</hi> Magick, which hath been invented by ſome antient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170457:60"/>of the Sects of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who would have found a way, by which they might have ſubjected the good <hi>Daemons</hi> to them, and reconcile them to themſelves, and which hath from them paſſed to the <hi>Jewiſh Cabaliſts,</hi> and from them to the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> are an invincible argument that there are Magicians and Daemons. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and averr'd Relations of the <hi>Northern</hi> Countries, and of both the <hi>Indies,</hi> do teſtifie, that all thoſe places do ſwarm with them, and that there is ſcarce one, which hath not his <hi>Daemon,</hi> and Familiar ſpirit. That <hi>Aignan</hi> of the people called <hi>Toupinambous,</hi> and the <hi>Demons,</hi> which preſide over other Barbaro us people, and which do torment and perplex them moſt greivouſly, is a ſufficient argument, that they be none, but evill ſpirits. And it is to be noted, that where there is none, or very ſmall knowledge of the true God, there it is, where the Devils have more power over men, and where they do alſo moſt commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; as having in thoſe places a greater Liberty from God, who gives them power to Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize and domineer over thoſe, who know not their Creatour and Benefactour.</p>
               <p>The Religion of thoſe of <hi>China,</hi> and of moſt part of the <hi>Indians</hi> is nought elſe, but an open profeſſion that they make of adoring the Devil, whom they reverence and honour,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170457:61"/>that he may do them no harm; thinking that the Deity hath no need of ſuch ſervices, and that, (being perfectly good) it will never do them any hurt, and will (without all theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices) do them good, whenſoever they need it.</p>
               <p>The multitude of Gods, which anciently the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Heathens did adore, and that diſtinction which they made of them, in <hi>deos majorum &amp; minorum gentium,</hi> of <hi>Gods, Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods, Heroes</hi> of divers ſorts, <hi>Satyres, Fauns, Pans, Aegypans, Nymphs</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>Joves, Vejoves;</hi> all this in effect was nothing, but a diſtinction of <hi>Daemons,</hi> which did veile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under theſe names, and ſo cauſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be adored by men. And their books are full of theſe <hi>Daemons,</hi> and all, or the moſt part of their ſuperſtitions, were brought up by the commands of theſe falſe Gods, which did ſpeak, and had ſociety with theſe ſuperſtitious perſons, and which were adored by them, as if indeed they had been Gods. Their Oracles alſo ſo famous among them, and ſo much taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in divers places, are ſo many Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of this truth, that there are <hi>Daemons,</hi> and immaterial ſpirits: theſe Oracles being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, then the utterings of theſe evill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, by which they did maintain the Heathens in their ſuperſtitions and Idolatries.</p>
               <p>All theſe things do plainly ſhew, that there are <hi>'Daemons,</hi> and conſequently a Deity, which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170457:61"/>is above them; as heretofore it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Wherein are anſwered all the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are brought against the foregoing Argument.</head>
               <p>MAN, who is ingenious enough in his own deſtruction, doth here endeavour to deceive himſelfe, and to enervate the ſtrength of the forementioned argument. There are ſome that think that all things that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of Witches and Magicians, and of all their wonderfull and prodigious Effects, are old wives Fables, and meer inventions, and the ground of their opinion is; becauſe (ſay they) notwithſtanding that they have deſired &amp; loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked after ſuch things, and having for theſe ends made their addreſſes to thoſe that were repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted famous, and notable Magicians, and Witches, and having deſired and ſolicited them (with promiſes of great Rewards) to ſhew them ſomething extraordinary and ſtrange, they could never obtain it of them, notwithſtanding all their intreaties; but theſe men do not conſider that (if what they ſay is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170457:62"/>true) it is a plot of Sathan; who, to confirm them in their erroneous Opinion, and by theſe means to make them ſurer to himſelf, hath declined to ſatisfie their curioſity on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: being rather willing to have ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Atheiſts, then to deterr them, and make them quit their Errours, by affrighting and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing them with thoſe things that they had ſeen. Others ſay, that there are many fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things reported of ſuch perſons, and of their Effects, and of the Apparitions of Spirits, and from this they take an occaſion not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing that is ſaid of them, as if they were all forgeries. But, although there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things falſly reported of them, and that many do delight in inventing ſuch things, we may not therefore conclude, that all things that are ſaid of them are falſe, and that there are no ſuch perſons, nor Daemons. Nay, we may conclude to the contrary, that ſuch ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries could not be raiſed, if there was no ground for them: For who would believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch things; if there had never been any apparitions of Spirits, nor any ſtrange Effects cauſed by Witches. For falſhood is in ſome manner a conſequent of Truth, and can finde no admittance in mens beliefs; but under ſome colour of Truth. Vnleſs there were a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Virtue in Plants, Stones, Metals, and Natural bodies, to produce ſeverall wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170457:62"/>effects, there could not be ſo many Fables of their Powers, as we read in <hi>Solinus, Pliny,</hi> and ſuch Writers. One muſt indeed, with judgement and diſcretion, diſcern in ſuch things that which is fabulous and untrue from thoſe that are averr'd and atteſted by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and irrefragable Witneſſes; of which we have an infinite number, but one may not therefore preſently condemn all things that are ſaid and writ by credible perſons, without making any difference between that which is falſe, and that which is true: Eſpecially, when ſuch men have no by-end in relating theſe things For, if it were ſo, we might not upon the ſame account believe, that there ever were ſuch men as <hi>Regnault</hi> and <hi>Roland,</hi> becauſe there have been many <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Tales</hi> made of them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who are the <hi>Wizards</hi> Patrons think to excuſe them; Firſt, By ſaying, that all things, which are told of their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> (or Conventicles) and of all thoſe things that are done there, is nought, but a meer imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a troubled brain, and no real truth; which they maintain to have been verified, in that there have been ſome, who believing and maintaining, that they have been ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reporting what they had ſeen and done; have for all that been found lying in their Beds at that very time, or lying as if
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170457:63"/>they had been dead, altogether inſenſible, and in an Extaſie: Whence they conclude that all thoſe tranſports are meerly imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to thoſe harms they think to do, (as for example, to raiſe ſtorms, and to ſend the Vermin into fields and houſes, to cauſe a Rot to fall upon the cattell, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict grievous diſeaſes upon thoſe men, that they bewitch) their Abettors think to excuſe them, in ſaying, that the Devill, fore-ſeeing theſe things to come, perſwades theſe execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people, that they are the cauſe of all theſe things, and that they do all by their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries and charms; although there is no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or virtue in the charms themſelves. But firſt, by ſaying thus, they grant that, which we would have, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are <hi>Daemons;</hi> whence we infer, that there is alſo a God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them, and they muſt of neceſſity grant it: For how can thoſe people, without the help of the Devill, foreſee thoſe ſtorms and tempeſts, thoſe Vermin, and thoſe Mortalities to come? And if they did propheſie thoſe things by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes, why ſhould they endeavour to make them come to paſs by their Sorceries? why ſhould they fancy to themſelves, that their Charms are the cauſe of them? Add to this, that theſe ſtormes and Tempeſts are moſt commonly ſo terrible and furious, and the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170457:63"/>Effects of them ſo ſtrange and wonderfull; that it plainly appears, that theſe things do not proceed meerly from Natural Cauſes; but that there is with them ſomething ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, which gives them their ſo ſtrange vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and motion.</p>
               <p>And as to thoſe harms which theſe perſons confeſſe themſelves to be guilty of: Albeit their Inchantments had not that power, as to cauſe them, it cannot therefore follow that they are not guilty, becauſe they will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do it: and to this purpoſe they make Compact with the Devill to help them: This evill purpoſe joyned with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact renders them wholly inexcuſable. Even as he is not to be pardoned, who, not thinking himſelfe able to kill his Enemy, doth implore the help of another to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. Theſe Sorceries therefore, being the ſignes of the Compact they have made with the Devil, and ſufficient proofs of their ill Will, and of the endeavours to bring it to paſſe, do render them wholly guilty; and the leſſe ſtrength and Phyſicall Virtue their <hi>Sortileges</hi> have, the more clearly its ſeene, that there is ſome ſupernaturall Cauſe, that produces theſe Effects, which Cauſe can be none other, but the Devill, with whom they have made an agreement to do it. And if there is ſome Phyſical
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170457:64"/>Virtue in any of thoſe things, that they uſe, to cauſe ſtrange diſeaſes, and thoſe Plagues, which they afflict men withall, they muſt needs have been taught to uſe them by the Devil; they not being able to know theſe Virtues by any Study or Experience, or the power of any thing they uſe in their Sorceries; being that they be all, or moſt of them, rude, illiterate, ignorant, and ſtupid perſons.</p>
               <p>But, beſides this, we muſt neceſſarily grant, that <hi>Sathan</hi> hath a great power over the <hi>'Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners</hi> and <hi>Magicians,</hi> who do propheſie and reveal things to come, and things occult; which they cannot do by any art, and which cannot be known to them, but by the help of the Devils. The like doth appear in thoſe, monſtrous and ſtrange things, which thoſe that make their addreſſes to theſe <hi>Magicians,</hi> do ſee, feel, and hear. For theſe things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be by any art effected, but proceed meerly from the power and efficacy of the <hi>Daemons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the extaſies of <hi>Witches,</hi> during which they really think themſelves to be carried to their <hi>Sabbaths</hi> (or meetings) and there to ſee, feel, and do many ſtrange and monſtrous things; although their tranſport was not real and corporeal, but only an imagined one: (to which many Relations of the Reality of them, and which alſo are verified, are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary) they nevertheleſs are highly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170457:64"/>becauſe ſuch Extaſies, and all thoſe things they think they do and ſee at that time, proceeding from the Devil, with whom they have made a Contract, cannot have their Riſe from any Phyſical and ordinary cauſe; ſince that Natural Cauſes do not operate at mans will and pleaſure. For thoſe Extaſies come to them when they lift, and do not at all happen, unleſs they have a minde to it.</p>
               <p>Finally, there are ſome, who pretend, that whatſoever wonders are ſpoken of <hi>Witches, Diviners, Magicians,</hi> and poſſeſſed perſons, do or may proceed from Natural Cauſes. And there are ſubtile men, and great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, which have employed all their parts and abilities to demonſtrate this; and to this end do inſtance in ſeveral wonderfull effects, which proceed meerly from Phyſical Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>It is very true, that in Natural bodies there are wonderfull qualities, and proprieties, both manifeſt and occult; which produce Effects to the amazement of thoſe that are ignorant of their Cauſes. And thoſe, that have diligently enquired into the ſecrets of Nature, have written ſomething of Natural Magick, where they muſter many examples of ſuch ſtrange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and proprieties; but all that they have writ comes nothing near to that, which the <hi>Witches, Magicians</hi> and <hi>Diviners</hi> do bring to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170457:65"/>paſs, and in this we muſt acknowledge, that thoſe people have another gueſs Maſter then theſe; <hi>viz,</hi> The Devil himſelfe. For ſuch people, (being all, or moſt of them, Rude, Illiterate, and unexperienced men) cannot have learned of themſelves to do theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things by any acquired Knowledge of the Virtues and Proprieties of Natural things, of which they cannot diſcourſe; nor render any pertinent Reaſon. Which doth evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, that what they do is not by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Knowledge, that they have of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult virtues of Naturall things, but that all theſe things proceed from the miniſtry and help of the Devill: who doth not teach them theſe Virtues of Natural things neither, but only imploy them as perſons, with whom he hath made a Contract, to the end they may practiſe ſuch wicked things, the cauſes of which they knew not at all.</p>
               <p>All Natural Bodies are ſo compoſed, that they have qualities and proprieties, by vvhich they do act, one on the other, or do mutually ſuffer ſome alterations, the one by the other; whence the naturall Sympathies and Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies do ariſe. From theſe virtues and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties proceed all the alterations and changes tranſmutations and effects, which are ſeen in nature: And if one could exactly know all theſe virtues and qualities, and ſhould apply
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170457:65"/>them exactly <hi>agentia patientibus,</hi> he would doubtleſs produce very ſtrange Effects, and wonderfull to thoſe, that ſhould be ignorant of their Cauſes. All which the Devils knowing exactly, and being able to do theſe things, they (I ſay) having an (almoſt-perfect) knowledge of Nature, and of the Qualities, Vertues, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of natural things, and applying them fitly by their activity and motion, which is not at all perceptible to us; it is no wonder, if they do, by the hands of <hi>Witches, Diviners,</hi> and <hi>Magicians,</hi> ſo many ſtrange things, which make men to wonder at them, even to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement.</p>
               <p>It is commonly held, and, it may be, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon; That all the operation of <hi>Daemons</hi> doth conſiſt in their local motion. By which, Firſt, they are carried from place to place, though never ſo farr diſtant, almoſt in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or imperceptible ſpace of time: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they move, and tranſport Phyſical bodies, though never ſo great, or heavy, with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ſtrength: Thirdly, They mix and compound diverſe bodies together by their ſtrength and power: Fourthly, they mix, and, as it were, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate themſelves in thoſe bodies, and thereby make them to act as they pleaſe: Fifthly, they ſtupiſie, diminiſh, ſtrengthen, augment, and animate, the virtues and proprieties of all things. For, they knowing all the virtues, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170457:66"/>Proprieties of all bodies, &amp; being able, through their activity and local motion, to apply <hi>quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet agens cuilibet patienti,</hi> they eaſily do all thoſe things, which are reported of the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Wizards,</hi> and <hi>Magicians.</hi> And in this ſenſe we may ſay, that all theſe things are done by Natural Cauſes; becauſe (as it hath been ſaid before) they are done by the application of Natural Cauſes: but this application of Cauſes Natural is not, nor cannot be done by the <hi>Magicians</hi> and <hi>Diviners</hi> without the help of Devils. Firſt, becauſe the ſaid perſons, being commonly rude, illiterate, and ignorant men, they cannot have any knowledge of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things: and Secondly, though they had an hundred times more knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, then indeed they have, yet it ſhould not be ſufficient to produce thoſe Effects. And again, had they ſuch a knowledge, yet could not they apply <hi>agentia patientibus,</hi> with that promptneſs and ability, which is requiſite in the production of thoſe Effects. So that we may conclude, that it is neceſſary that the <hi>Daemons</hi> ſhould have ſome influence in the production of theſe Effects.</p>
               <p>For example, By what Natural Cauſe can a <hi>Diviner</hi> know thoſe things which are hidden, and the which he reveales, and which have been done in a time, and place utterly unknown to any, but the Authours of thoſe actions, as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170457:66"/>the revealing of Murthers, Poyſonings, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Rapes, Thefts, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> and by what natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe could the two horſemen, in the ſhape of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> bring tidings to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> in their publique place, of the Victory their Conſul had gained in <hi>Macedonia</hi> but a few hours before? And by what natural means can a foot-man go in few hours four or five hundred miles, which the beſt Poſts can ſcarce do in many dayes? and a thouſand like wonderfull effects? So then, it appears (from that we have ſhown, that they are <hi>Witches,</hi> and <hi>Magicians,</hi> which do theſe things) that they are Devils, which are the true cauſes of theſe effects, and whoſe Inſtruments the <hi>Witches</hi> are.</p>
               <p>Now, if there are evil ſpirits, there is no reaſon to deny, that there are good ones too. For good doth precede the evil; evil being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the corruption of goodneſſe. Whence it neceſſarily followes, that theſe evil ſpirits were good at firſt; but that they have corrupted themſelves afterwards. And, if there are good and evil Angels, we muſt conclude, that there is a Deity above them, from which they have had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which doth conduct the one, and reſtrain the other. For, were it not ſo, that inceſſant jarring, and contrariety, which would be among them, would neceſſarily cauſe the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170457:67"/>ruine and ſubverſion of all the World, and of all the bodies, over which they have ſo much power. Again, what reaſon is there to deny there is a Deity, if it is once granted, that there are good and bad Angels, which are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, immaterial, inviſible, immortal, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and intelligent ſubſtances? For above theſe there is nought, but the Deity; of whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they do very much participate, and which doth excell them only, in that it is Infinite, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, and Eternal.</p>
               <p>Again, if there are evil Spirits, or Devils, there is an Hell, where they are placed, which is their priſon, and the priſon of thoſe wicked and abominable ones, which do follow, and imitate them in their wickedneſs. And, if there are good Angels, there is a Paradiſe for their Manſion, and for the dwelling of thoſe good and virtuous perſons, which are like unto them: and above all a God, a righteous Judg, which avengeth the one, and rewardeth the other.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The ninth <hi>Argument,</hi> drawn from the Univerſal Conſent of the World, That there is a Deity.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond kind of Reaſoning againſt the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> is from Authority, or Record: which is two-fold, <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane.</hi> I call that <hi>Divine</hi> Teſtimony, which is drawn from the holy Writ: I call that <hi>Humane,</hi> but yet unqueſtionable, Teſtimony, the Conſent of all the men in the world; all of which do naturally acknowledge, that there is a Deity and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And here we muſt take notice, Firſt, that the moſt ancient Philoſophers, and the moſt eminent and illuſtrious perſons in Learning and Virtue, of whom any mention is made in Hiſtory, have acknowledged a Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which ſeeth, knoweth, and rules all things, rewards the one, and puniſheth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Secondly, all the People, and Nations of the Earth, which are; or ever have been, have acknowledged this ſame truth? Which is evident, becauſe there was never any, that hath not profeſſed ſome Religion, or inſtead
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170457:68"/>of it an open and manifeſt communion, and a familiar converſation with evill ſpirits; as theſe ſavage and brutiſh Nations have, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Toupinambous, Margajas, Caribes, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibales, Patagons,</hi> and the like, and thoſe <hi>Septentrional</hi> Nations, which are neerer to our <hi>Arctick</hi> Pole, in <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and the <hi>New world,</hi> as it appears by the Relations of them, which at this day are common and vulgar.</p>
               <p>Now we have proved heretofore, that, if there are Devils, there is a Deity; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently thoſe Nations, acknowledging that there are <hi>Daemons,</hi> by that commerce which they have with them, do alſo tacitely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and are forced to grant, that there is a Deity. Every Religion alſo doth imply, that there is a Deity: For it is wholly imployed in the ſervice and adoration of it, and to make it propitious, and mercifull to men, and to obtain from it, either the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe things that are deſired, or an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from thoſe evils that are feared, or ſuffered either in this life, or in the other: and this is done either by Prayers, Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Acknowledgements, Thankſgivings; or by Sacrifices, and other Ceremonies. This is the end of all Religions.</p>
               <p>Since therefore, that there hath been no People, or Nation, whether civilized, (as in old
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170457:68"/>time, the Heathen <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Graecians,</hi> the <hi>Chaldaeans, Babylonians, Aſſyrians,</hi> and <hi>Perſians, Syrians, Phaenicians, Aegr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians</hi>) or barbarous, (as the <hi>Scythians, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans,</hi> and infinite others) that hath not had, and profeſſed ſome Religion; it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that all have with one conſent acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>As to the ſtrength and validity of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, it is (as hath been ſaid) not to be doubted of, eſpecially, if it may be ſhown, that there is no juſt Cauſe or Reaſon to doubt of this Teſtimony. Let's then ſee, whether any may juſtly doubt of it. One may be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe a falſe opinion three manner of waies:</p>
               <p>Firſt, By affection, and deſire, that we have it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By Authority.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By ſpecious and deceiving Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But none of theſe waies can agree with that, which is now in queſtion.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, There is ſuch a Connexion between the Intellect and the Will, that as the Will alwaies follows the Dictates of the Underſtanding, ſo it doth deſire that which the Intellect judges to be good. So alſo we eaſily perſwade our ſelves that, which we deſire with Paſſion: man being inclined by this deſire to ſeek all the Reaſons that may be to perſwade
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170457:69"/>himſelfe of the truth and goodneſs of that which he deſireth, and giving weight unto them by this ſtrong and vehement affection.</p>
               <p>But here it cannot be ſaid, that men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that there is a God, becauſe they do deſire it; but contrariwiſe the moſt part of men would, that there were none, becauſe they fear him as a Judge. There is therefore much more Reaſon to ſuſpect, that the opinion of the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> is falſe, and juſtly to object againſt them, that they perſwade themſelves there is none, becauſe they ſo ardently wiſh that it were ſo; and that this their ſo vehement deſire makes them to receive the moſt weak Reaſons for good and ſolid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations.</p>
               <p>As to Authority, one ſometimes may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a thing upon the meer Reſpect, that he hath to the perſons that ſay it, and that, either becauſe ſuch perſons are ſufficient and able, and that he believes them to be ſo, or becauſe of that eminent power and Authority in which they are, which hath only place in thoſe things, which one cares not much whether they be true or not, and where he ſees no Reaſons to the contrary.</p>
               <p>It cannot be ſaid, that men have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe a Deity and Providence by the bare Authority and Reſpect that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had, which had no ground or Reaſon for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170457:69"/>what they ſaid For who is he, that hathſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally been known to be of ſuch Sufficiency, Knowledge, and Ability, as to perſwade men, only by the bare Reſpect they had of him, to believe a thing ſo great, and that doth ſo much concern them? For, beſides that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> who is acknowledged to have been the greateſt and learnedſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher that ever was, is not ſo much as known by name to the thouſandſt part of the World, it is certain, that none that believes there is a Deity will confeſs, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it, becauſe ſuch a one ſaid it; but only becauſe he hath an inward perſwaſion of this Truth by ſome Reaſons, which he knowes and underſtands well himſelfe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though very often times he cannot expreſs them.</p>
               <p>And as for Eminency and Dignity, there was never yet any, that hath ruled over all the World, and who might have had the power to command or perſwade men to believe a Deity. Beſides, that the Belief, which proceeds this way, ought to be of things, which we care not much, whether they be true or not; which cannot be ſaid of the Deity and Providence, there being nothing more important, or that doth more highly concern men.</p>
               <p>But perhaps it may be objected, That this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170457:70"/>opinion hath ſpread it ſelf by Tradition from Fathers to Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo is come to us. Now it's very true, that the firſt man, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> hath taught this truth to his Children, and they to theirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by theſe means this Truth hath been believ'd over all the World.</p>
               <p>But firſt, although he hath ſo taught his poſterity, we may not therefore conclude, that all have believed him: for there have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been wicked ones, that have not cared for their Fathers admonitions, and thoſe alſo have not taken pains to make their Children to believe it; ſo that this pretended Tradition hath been in many places interrupted, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. So that we muſt confeſs, that this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal belief of a Deity hath another cauſe then Tradition, or meer Inſtitution. Add to it, that this thing is of too much concernment to be believed upon the bare word of our Fathers: which indeed may give an occaſion to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this truth, and incline our minds to believe it; but cannot be the only true ground of ſo firmly-inherent a belief.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to thoſe, againſt whom we diſpute, which hold the Eternity of the world; how can they, (keeping ſtill to this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz, That the world is Eternal</hi>) Object, That this opinion hath its Riſe from meer Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For I will ask them, Whether they think
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170457:70"/>that this Opinion is Eternal, as well as the world? or whether it hath had ſome beginning again? If this opinion is Eternal, I will ask, Whether it was generally received among all men, or received of ſome only? If they ſay, That it hath alwaies been Univerſal, it follows, that it is natural, and therefore a true opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and theirs conſequently falſe. If this Opinion hath not been Univerſal, but yet was from all Eternity received among ſome, it follows that it is at leaſt as true an opinion as theirs is; ſince it hath had followers, and hath been received from all Eternity as well as theirs.</p>
               <p>But theſe two Opinions being contrary one to another, they cannot both be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, nor conſequently equally Eternal: and ſo neceſſarily the one is true, and the other falſe; the one <hi>Prior,</hi> the other <hi>Poſterior:</hi> truth being alwaies before falſhood, which is a diſguiſing of Truth and an aberration from it.</p>
               <p>Here then will they ſay, that their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is the firſt, and Eternal, the other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving followed long time after. If this is true, then it follows, that all men Univerſally, in an infinite number of Ages, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly held this opinion, <hi>That there is no God:</hi> how then is it come into the minds of men to hold the contrary to that, which they had alwaies held and believed? And how could any
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170457:71"/>one imagine that he could perſwade this to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one? Yea, how is it poſſible, that men ſhould now hold a contrary opinion, but that they have acknowledged by ſtrong Reaſons, that the other opinion was falſe?</p>
               <p>So then we cannot conclude, neither accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> nor accoding to ours, that this univerſal belief of the Deity is a meer Tradition and proceeds from Inſtitution; but it muſt neceſſarily be concluded, that it proceeds from that men have unanſwerable Arguments for it, upon which both it and its evidence is grounded.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> would willingly reply, that thoſe arguments are but captious and weak, &amp; have no ſolidity in them. But there is no reaſon to think ſo. For, how is it poſſible, that a meer Phantaſm or ſhadow, without any real ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, ſhould have deceived all the men in the whole world: and that ſo conſtantly, ſince ſo many ages; that there hath been none found among ſo many men, that hath demonſtrated as yet the pretended vanity and weakneſs of theſe Arguments?</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible, that none hath been found among ſo many wonderfully-learned men, of which Hiſtory makes mention; that hath evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced the pretended falſhood of this opinion, and demonſtrated how weak and vain thoſe Arguments are, on which this our opinion is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170457:71"/>grounded; and by theſe meanes free the World from the checks and terrours, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their crimes cauſes in them, when they conſider and perceive that there is a Divine Providence? This doubtleſs would have found place enough in the belief of men.</p>
               <p>But, it may be, it will be ſaid, that <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and his followers, and ſome others afore him, have done this, teaching <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and the Reaſons that may perſwade to it.</p>
               <p>Now, thoſe Perſons have indeed had wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and very good Reaſons, to jear at all the vain ſuperſtitions, fooliſh and extravagant opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Religion of the Heathen, at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and fabulous Stories, that they made of their Gods, of the multitude of them, and at the falſe imagination they had of the ſtate of the dead in Hell, or in the <hi>Elyſian</hi> fields.</p>
               <p>But it will not be found, nor confeſſed, that they have ſtrong and ſolid Reaſons, to prove, that there is no Providence. And thoſe prophane ones of our dayes, who think they have refined <hi>Atheiſm</hi> to the height, will be found as ſhort in their Arguments, if they are examined by the rules of right Reaſon: and it will be found, that the Reaſon, why they are eſtecmed and counted excellent Wits, is not ſo much becauſe of the ſtrength of their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170457:72"/>Arguments, as becauſe nothing is either too hot or too cold for them, and that there is no abſurdity, though it be never ſo great, which they do not eaſily ſwallow, like to the ſtrong ſtomachs of <hi>Oſtriches,</hi> which do digeſt any thing that is given them.</p>
               <p>And here we ſhould enter upon the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their pretended Reaſons, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theirs and ours, which we have brought againſt them; that there might be a Judgement given, which are the moſt ſolid and firm: but this would engage us to another Treatiſe, whereupon we have not now a deſign to enter; but will examine ſome of them towards the end of this book. That, which hath been ſaid hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto againſt them, being well weighed and conſidered, will be found ſo agreeable to right Reaſon, that, if their opinion is true, they muſt diſpute otherwiſe then by Reaſon, and muſt be farr above it, and ſo conſequently muſt be much more then men.</p>
               <p>But, albeit their Reaſons were of equal weight with ours, (which is not ſo) yet have we much advantage on our ſide.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe, beſides theſe Reaſons, we have this univerſal conſent, which they have not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe, though there were no God, yet there is no danger, and little or no loſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and ſerve one: but, if there is one, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:170457:72"/>for not believing and ſerving him, are in great danger to have Hell for their portion.</p>
               <p>One thing may be objected againſt this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conſent of all Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are errours and falſe opinions, which yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs have been believed, and received by moſt, or all the Nations of the Earth: as for example; Idolatry, Multiplicity of the Gods of the Heathen, and in the moſt civiliz'd Nations, and People, (as among the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>) Whoredom, and the ſin againſt Nature, have ſcarce been accounted vices; &amp; there have been whole Nations, and People, where Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, and Theft, eſpecially if it was committed upon thoſe of another Nation, was not looked upon as crime or ſin.</p>
               <p>But, The anſwer to this is not difficult:</p>
               <p>For Firſt, theſe errours, though very general, have not been ſo conſtant and univerſal, as the belief of a Deity. For <hi>Chriſtianiſm</hi> hath aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Paganiſm</hi> in a very conſiderable part of the World, and was once more univerſal then it is now. And the <hi>Mahometan, Jeniſh</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religions, all of which hold, there is one only God, compared with the reſt of the World, which yet remains plunged in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Idolatry, do almoſt, or, it may be, altogether comprehend the half of thoſe men, which are upon the face of the Earth. Now, the opinion of one only God, ſo as the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170457:73"/>Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> do hold, it is farr more contrary to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> then the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Idolatry. How is it then, if <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> opinions be true, that the opinion of the <hi>Jews, Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> hath ſo much prevailed over that of the Heathen, which comes much nearer to <hi>Atheiſm?</hi> Eſpecially, ſince the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, which hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded that of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> was propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only by the patience and ſufferings of the Profeſſours of it, which every where have been expoſed and abandoned to the rage, fury, and perſecution of the Heathen.</p>
               <p>The Heatheniſh Idolatry, and Superſtition, is an opinion much more ſuitable to our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſenſe, and which corrupted man doth love, and cheriſh much more, then the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> have of one God. Therefore (as we have noted heretofore) its no wonder, that this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had ſpread it ſelf very much: ſince we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves very willingly and eaſily of thoſe things, which we earneſtly deſire, and wiſh for. But this ſame fleſh is wholly repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant to the belief of a Deity, that judgeth and Governeth the World, and renders to every man according to what he had done. How comes it then to paſs, that the opinion, which we have of one only God, hath prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Heatheniſh Idolatry and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170457:73"/>and doth yet maintain it ſelf againſt ſo many <hi>Atheiſts</hi> as are at this day: ſince that we arm and defend our ſelves, as much as we can, againſt thoſe things, which we fear and dread?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Heatheniſh Idolatry, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, is an alteration and corruption of the opinion of a Deity, and doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily preſuppoſe it, as its ground, and <hi>baſis.</hi> And this alteration (as I ſaid juſt now) is wonderfully more accommodated to our fleſhly and ſenſual corruptions, then the belief of an only God. It is therefore no wonder, if the opinion of a Deity, being ſo univerſally received, and ſo deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heart of man, the Heatheniſh I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and Superſtition (which pleaſeth the fleſh) hath ſpread it ſelf alſo ſo much as it hath. But the opinion of a Deity is not a corruption, or alteration of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> It is quite contrary. And this belief of a Deity doth not pleaſe the fleſh, as <hi>Atheiſm</hi> doth. Therefore the belief of a Deity could not have ſo univerſally won the ſpirits of men, but by its own proper ſtrength and virtue, which conſiſteth in Truth, which is ſtronger then all things. And it's much to be wondered at, (and the <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l never give a pertinent Reaſon of it) why, if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> be true, it hath not been ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170457:74"/>received, as its contrary; but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, and almoſt every where, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen, it hath been abhorred, and deteſted of all. As to thoſe other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities, of Whoredom, Thefts, and the ſin againſt Nature, and the like; beſides, that the moſt honeſt perſons, in every Nation, have acknowledged in theſe actions a great deal of filthineſs, and injuſtice, when they have ſpoken of them in good earneſt (though the corrupted and baſe pleaſures of the fleſh, and the depraved ſenſe of their luſts, had ſo blinded their underſtanding, that they let themſelves looſe to all theſe vices, without any great remorſe) it is not of theſe errours, as of the belief of a Deity: for theſe vices pleaſe, and intice ſenſuality, and therefore men are eaſily perſwaded to them; but the belief of a Deity is wholy repugnant to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, which would perſwade it ſelf the contrary if it could: and nevertheleſſe this opinion hath forced mens underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to aſſent to it; which could not be done, but by the meer ſtrength of truth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid before, it is plain and evident, that this ſo univerſal, and conſtant conſent of all men, (who hold, and believe, even in ſpight of themſelves, that there is a God, and a Providence) is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170457:74"/>an indubitable Argument of this truth, and an evidence of the deprivation of man, by which he is fallen from his firſt Nature, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by which he was joyned and united to God; unto whom he was conformable in Truth, Juſtice, and Holineſs, as one cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to his own Image: and from which he is now ſeparated, and alienated, through his Injuſtice, Pollution, and Perverſeneſs, which doth incline him to deny this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which he feareth as his Judg.</p>
               <p>And in this Infidelity of Man, God would not leave himſelfe without a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but hath lively engraved, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed himſelfe in his Works: ſo that man, maugre himſelfe, is forced in thoſe things to acknowledge this Deity.</p>
               <p>And this is to convince man of his errour, and to make good the Juſtice of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and the righteouſneſſe of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt their impiety.</p>
               <p>And, from what hath been ſaid, appears the ſtrength of this Teſtimony, againſt which nothing, which is conſiderable, can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: as being a Teſtimony, not only Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, or proceeding from the fancy, or will of man; but in effect a Divine one, as being the meer motion of Nature, and the dictate of Reaſon, and wherein this Proverb is verified; <hi>Vox Populi, Vox Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:170457:75"/>
               <p>But let us paſs from this <hi>Humane</hi> Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to that which is directly <hi>Divine.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> The laſt <hi>Argument,</hi> Drawn from the Teſtimony of the Holy Scriptures; the Divinity of which is proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ABove all theſe Proofs and Reaſons, which have been brought heretofore againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> is that, which is drawn from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Holy Scriptures, contained in the Books of the Old and New Teſtaments; which teach and inculcate to us nothing elſe, then an only true God, maker of Heaven and Earth, what he is, his Virtues, his Perfections, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties and Attributes, his Works, as well of the Creation of the World, and his Governing of it, as alſo thoſe of mans Redemption, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Deſigns, the Decrees of his Will concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Humane kind, the Salvation of the one, the Condemnation of the others; alſo the Honour, Reſpect, Service, and Adoration, which we are bound to pay unto him, and which he doth alſo
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170457:75"/>require of us, what we ought to fear, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and hope from him: in ſumm the true and only means to be perfectly and eternally happy; which is that which all men do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſire, and wiſh for, and at which all their actions do aim.</p>
               <p>So that, if theſe Sacred Books are true, and not forged, and invented by the Artifice or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of wily and deceitfull men, it's evident and not to be doubted, that there is a God, and that he is ſuch an one as is there deſcribed to us.</p>
               <p>To which the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> reply nothing, but this. Who, ſay they, will warrant us, that what thoſe Writers ſay is true, and that their deſign hath not been to impoſe upon our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs, and deceive us? <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſay they, ſays very much, but proves nothing; intimating that he is a Tale-teller; and that he will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved upon his bare word. And one of them hath ſaid, That our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to give the more weight to his Doctrine, hath called himſelf (but falſly) the <hi>Son of God,</hi> yea <hi>God himſelf.</hi> Thoſe perſons imagine, and will have the World believe, that theſe Divine wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are ſuch as <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> who did attribute his <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> to the Deity of the <hi>Nymph Aegeria,</hi> with whom he pretended to have familiar Converſation; or as <hi>Mahc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,</hi> who ſaith, that he received his <hi>Alcoran</hi> from the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:170457:76"/>
               <p>It's not my deſign to proceed very far in this point &amp; to prove at large againſt ſuch perſons the Divinity of the Holy Scriptures. 'Tis too large a ſubject for the narrow bounds of this ſmall treatrſe, beſides, it would be <hi>Actum agere,</hi> ſince that all thoſe of the Holy Fathers of the Church; or Learned Divines, which have lived ſince theſe 200 years, which have demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the truth of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion againſt the Heatheniſh, and other Sects which have been raiſed ſince, have ever begun this way; this being the very <hi>Baſis,</hi> Hinge, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true Religion, which is, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on purpoſe, or not I know not) baſely betrayed to the <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> by thoſe; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the Scripture hath no authority over us, but only as thoſe, who call themſelves the Church, give it that power and validity. For, ſetting aſide the Scripture, theſe perſons, who call themſelves the Church, cannot demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their pretended infallibility, nor prove, and perſwade the world, that they ought to be beleived upon their bare word whatever they ſay: as the Divinity of the Scriptures may be demonſtrated to profane perſons upon their own Authority, and by themſelves.</p>
               <p>I will only, for the ending of this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, bring ſome general Conſiderations, by which one may ſee the fooliſhneſs and vanity of this frivolous exception of the <hi>Atheists,</hi> and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170457:76"/>of their falſe accuſations, in ſaying that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture is nothing but a dream and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, without certain ground of Truth.</p>
               <p>There are then 4 principal things, which ſhew the impertinency of this exception. 1. The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and condition. 2. The number and diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 3. The Scope &amp; end of theſe Sacred Writers. And finally, The Nature and quality of the things they write. Theſe things being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it will appear, that thoſe things, which thoſe men have writ, are not Tales and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and things, which they have feigned to make the world beleive them. I will ſpeak of theſe four things very briefly, leaving thoſe things for any man to amplifie upon.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, Thoſe that make it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to deceive, and make Fables and Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are, for the moſt part, ſubtile, cunning, wary, and knaviſh perſons, and withall, of a low, or mean Condition: But great and high ſpirits, magnanimous and Heroical Souls, Kings, great Princes, and Monarchs, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of rare and exquiſite Learning, and of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime wiſdom, never ſtoop to ſo low and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy an imployment, as that of Juglers &amp; decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And thoſe, that are rude, ignorant, &amp; illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, and of too low and abject condition, are not fit or able to invent ſuch things, and to give ſo much colour to their forgeries, as to make them to be believed and received for currant.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170457:77"/>Now among the Sacred writers there are ſome of theſe two ſorts. There are Kings and Princes, great Captains and Conquerours, and emment Perſons in Dignity and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in Learning and incomparable Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>You have there a <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt eminent Captains and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that ever was. You have there <hi>David,</hi> one of the braveſt, moſt generous, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kings; and moſt eminent for his Valour, Battells, Feats of Arms, and Victories, that ever was ſeen. You have there <hi>Solomon,</hi> the moſt Rich, Magnificent, Illuſtrious, and Wiſeſt King that ever was in the World. You have <hi>Daniel,</hi> the firſt and chiefeſt Officer in the Court of the greateſt Monarchy in the World; in whom there was found more of true, high, and ſublime Wiſdome, then in all thoſe Wiſe men of that Nation, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, in which he was an Officer. You have <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> great and mighty Perſons, and of the chiefeſt in the Court of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which relate unto us their own Hiſtory. You have <hi>Job,</hi> a great, rich, and mighty Perſon in his time; yet greater in in Goodneſs, Patience, and incomparable Fortitude: who relates to us his own Hiſtory, and thoſe incomparable Diſcourſes held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170457:77"/>him and his Friends, upon the occaſion of his Afflictions. Briefly, you have <hi>Moſes,</hi> the moſt ancient of all theſe Writers, bred in the King of <hi>Egypt's</hi> Court, learned in all the Wiſdom of the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> who were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their Wiſdom above all the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth; but ſince, you have him endowed and filled with an higher and more admirable Wiſdom, which appears every where in his Writings: Who being compar'd with the greateſt, wiſeſt, and moſt renowned Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatours of the Heathen, they are leſs then Children to him, albeit they have learnt in his Schole what they have beſt and more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>Can perſons of this Nature and Temper, of that Quality and Condition, of ſo great and eminent Courage, ſo noble and ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſo wiſe and prudent; can they (I ſay) debaſe themſelves ſo much, as to buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in writing Forgeries? Or, is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; that they would follow, and confirm, and entertain other mens Impoſtures? Have <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander, Scipio</hi> and <hi>Cato, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and other like Perſons, eminent for Learning, Wiſdome, Virtue, Greatneſs, Riches, and Worldly Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Heathens, imployed themſelves in this vile Trade of impoſing on mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs, and writing of Tales?</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:170457:78"/>
               <p>On the other ſide, you have among the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours and Pen-men of the New Teſtament, our Lord <hi>Jeſut Chriſt,</hi> the firſt of all, and from whom all the reſt have learn't, who (unleſs he were in effect that, which he himſelf ſayes to be, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Son of God</hi>) was but the Son of a poor, and of a very mean woman, of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rank of the people. His Diſciples and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were, moſtof them, poor Fiſhermen; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, rude, illiterate, and ignorant perſons, (as ſuch kind of people uſe to be, and as it appears by their own Hiſtory in the <hi>Goſpel</hi>) before they were endowed with that Wiſdom from above, which came from Heaven. Are ſuch kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons fit to ſeduce and deceive all the World by their pretended Impoſtures, and that in ſpight of the moſt ſtrong and violent Reſiſtance, that all the powers of the Earth have made againſt it, by the moſt bloody and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſecutions, and by the Learning and ſubtility of the greateſt Philoſophers, who have hindered the Propagation of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion as much, as they poſſibly could?</p>
               <p>What great Cunning and Subtility, what ſtrong Reaſons and powerfull Perſwaſions, could proceed from Spirits ſo dejected, from ſo vile and abject perſons, from men ſo much deſpiſed? And how have they been able to over-reach, and abuſe all the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170457:78"/>World, and to captivate all Imaginations of men of whatſoever Age, Sex, Quality, and Condition to the Obedience of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> And how could ſuch men beat down and wholy ſubvert <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> which was ſo deeply roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Hearts of men, and upheld by the Authority of all the Supream Powers of the Earth? And, more then this, to perſwade men to reſolve with joy to looſe their Goods, Honours, Eſtates, Eſteem, and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea, to looſe their Life it ſelfe; and all that they had deareſt here below, yea, even to endure the moſt Horrible, and Exquiſite Torments of the Body, (as we ſee in the Examples of <hi>Martyrs</hi> of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Sexes, and Conditions, of all Nations, and People, in all places through the world, and that for a long time) for maintaining of a Ridiculous and Abſurd Story (if we believe the <hi>Atheists</hi>) upon the hopes of a pretended Imaginary Felicity after this Life; of which Happineſs they give no other Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the promiſes of this pretended Son of a Carpentar?</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible, that ſuch perſons ſhould imagine, that they could perſwade, and draw the VVorld to their Opinions, and delude them with their Dreams.</p>
               <p>VVe muſt then acknowledge in this the invincible ſtrength of Truth, and the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170457:79"/>and might of God, which hath acted, and ſtretched forth its ſelf in this ſo wonderful a work. The quality then, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Holy Pen-men, doth not argue; that they be Fables contained in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and that they are Impoſtours, and Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And ſo much for the firſt point, which might be much more enlarged.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond, Which is the number and diverſity of theſe Writers, it ſeldome, or never at all, happens, that many men, without any Communication, one with another, do conſpire, and agree to maintain, and uphold one and the ſame falſhood. For the mind of man, through the unlimited Love, that it hath towards it ſelf, is wonderfully various, and doth not agree with the Thoughts, Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Imaginations of others, every one being willing to flatter himſelf, and to be thought as good and induſtrious in his Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as another. Whence thoſe Compilers of <hi>Romances</hi> in our daies have all their ſeveral Inventions; and there is ſcarce any, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes the Invention and Deſign of another. But the Sacred Writers are many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, very much different as to time, and place. Since <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Apoſtles times, there are almoſt two thouſand years: during which ſpace of time, ſometimes in one age, ſometimes in another, and in divers places, and perſons of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170457:79"/>different degrees, conditions, and qualities, Kings, Princes, Lords, Captains, Courtiers, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, ſimple and ignorant people, Fiſhermen, Artiſts, Publicans, all agree in maintaining, and defending that pretended falſhood, that there is an only God, maker of Heaven and Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and give us the Hiſtory of a ſmall, but moſt wonderful, and illuſtrious Nation, (which doth yet ſubſiſt, diſperſed all over the world with ſo exact a connexion, ſince its firſt beginning, for the ſpace of two thouſand years. And theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which they give us, are ſo conſtant, and uniform, and ſo agreeable one to the other, that nothing in them is contradictory, or belies the other.</p>
               <p>Now, ſo admirable, and conſtant an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſo many heads, and perſons ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and ſeparated by times, ages, places; in ſo many and ſo ſtrange things, farr above the reach of Humane Reaſon, cannot be the effect or product of a falſe and lying Spirit, which commonly betrays himſelf, and his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and lies. How much more is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that ſo many perſons ſhould agree ſo well in theſe things, if they are Inventions and Fables? Beſides, the end and ſcope of theſe Scriptures doth plainly evidence the falſhood of this imputation, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Writers ſayings are but Fables.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, that go about to deceive the World,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170457:80"/>and to promulgate their abſurd Dreams and Inventions, do it commonly, or altogether, for one of theſe ends; either to get ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, pleaſure, profit, or riches, for themſelves, or for theirs; as are all Juglers, and cunning fellows: or to make ſome ſport, and to have the name and reputation of eloquent perſons, and brave wits; as Jeſters, thoſe that compile <hi>Romances,</hi> and the like pieces. Others, through vanity, and ſelf-conceitedneſs, that they may get admiration, praiſe, and eſteem from men, do maintain ſome Paradoxes, and new, ſtrange, and monſtrous opinions; as many did among the Heathen Philoſophers, and as the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks amongſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have done, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended their inventions, and abſurdities to any good end, as the Publick good, or the concernment of humane kind, or to induce men to follow virtue, and ſhew them the way to true happineſs.</p>
               <p>I believe, that no man in his wits will ſay, that the Sacred Hiſtories of the Old and New Teſtament are <hi>Romances,</hi> invented to delight men, and to gain the Writers the credit of worldly-eloquent perſons, and of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſſe of Wit, which is accounted ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. The ſtile, and manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe Books, is farr different from that of the <hi>Romances;</hi> and all the circumſtances of time, places, and perſons, are ſo punctually
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170457:80"/>obſerved, and every where ſo agreeing, that one muſt be barbarous, and wilde, or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtupid, and beſotted, that doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the wonderfull, and infinite difference there is betwixt theſe Sacred Hiſtories and the fabulous <hi>Romances.</hi> Beſides, that thoſe, who make <hi>Romances,</hi> compile them ſo (if they are able men) as that there is ſome likelihood in what they relate, and ſhun (as much as they can) the prodigious Fictions of <hi>Amadis.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, they clearly evidence, that they do not deſire to be believed in thoſe things, which they relate; but that their deſign is to charm (by the elegancy of the ſtile, their ingenious inventions, and the likelihood of thoſe things) the eyes of the minde, and to make it ſee thoſe things, which really are not, and to delight their Readers by this pleaſant cheat. But the Pen-men of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtories do propoſe them, as things certain, true, and indubitable, and deſire that they may be believed for ſuch. Which would be a groſſe folly in them, and a thing unworthy men of parts; if they were <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,</hi> forged and invented on purpoſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the ſtile of theſe Writings is very mean, and popular, and far from the way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thoſe, whoſe deſign it is to abuſe, and deceive the World. Neither will it be proved, that the Authours of theſe Sacred
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170457:81"/>Books have endeavoured to entrap and deceive men by their fictions, and inventions of honors, pleaſures, eſtates, or riches.</p>
               <p>Neither <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Joſhua,</hi> have endeavoured to leave the conduct of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Common-Wealth to their children. <hi>Moſes</hi> had no need to leave <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Court, to enjoy Honour and Riches; ſince, if he had ſtaid there, he might have been reputed the Son of the Daughter of <hi>Pharach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> hath not, by his <hi>Writings</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> acquired that glory and power, which he had: but hath got it by his Valour, by the Wars which he made, and the favour, and bleſſing of God, who hath protected and directed him. What needed he, being a great and mighty King, to buſie himſelf in compoſing of thoſe <hi>Pſalms;</hi> if they be but meer empty inventions? What humane end could he propoſe to himſelf in this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon,</hi> his ſon, hath not acquired, nor ſought after that Honour, Glory, and Riches, (which he hath poſſeſſed in greater meaſure, then all the reſt of the Kings of the Earth, Jin the compoſition of the <hi>Proverbs, Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> and <hi>Canticles.</hi> He enjoyed all theſe things, afore he writ any thing of theſe Books: and, in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> he ſhews plainly enough the little, or no eſteem he had of them.</p>
               <p>Have <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezechiel,</hi> and the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170457:81"/>twelve ſmall Prophets, ſought by their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings the goods, honours, and pleaſures of this World? They, who have been for this thing hated, derided, perſecuted, and put to death: and this not contrary to their deſign and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and againſt their will; for they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted willingly, and have undergone all thoſe evils in obedience to this God, who ſent them.</p>
               <p>Did our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles, follow and endeavour after theſe things? No, but quite contrariwiſe they do exhort and perſwade their Diſciples and followers, not to love or ſeek them: and rather to expect the croſſes, tribulations, and perſecutions of the World, for the Profeſſion of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they taught them.</p>
               <p>Shall we ſay, that vanity, and deſire of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry have led theſe Perſons to this, that they might gain the reputation of men of Parts, and of ſubtile Perſons. Nothing leſſe. Could the Apoſtles, who were poor fiſhermen, rude, illiterate, and ignorant perſons, aſpire to this Glory, and could they expect this credit from the men of their times, or from poſterity? Beſides, that their Writings are full of the contempt they had, and would every one of their Diſciples to have, of ſuch a glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> hath not ſought for this by his Writings: afore he writ he had that great
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170457:82"/>Wiſdom, which hath gained him the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt Learned, and Wiſe of all the men that went before him. And he hath had this credit and reputation; not by holding, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> and extravagant Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, invented by him, againſt the common Tenents of other men: but by a true and right Wiſdom, and an admirable Knowledge, which in effect he had of the Nature of all things. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> had acquired Glory and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit enough by their Archievements, without affecting this by their Writings, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Fantaſtical Opinions. If <hi>Moſes</hi> would have ſought after worldly glory, he would rather have acquired it by the VViſdom of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in which he had been inſtructed, and which was then in great repute in the World; then by inventing new Opinions, &amp; Doctrines. <hi>Daniel</hi> had enough of the Learning of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> which he knew well, to gain eſteem and reputation amongſt men, without broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new, unheard-of, and ſtrange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>So then, it is evident, that the deſire of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory hath not induced theſe Holy VVriters to tell us Dreams, and Phantaſms of their brain. VVhat then is it? Is it the affection to the Publique good, and their deſire they had to profit men, that hath moved them to tell us their new inventions, and ſtories of their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170457:82"/>own making? Sometimes indeed <hi>Fictions</hi> are uſed in Moral and Politick documents. <hi>Aeſop's Fables</hi> are all of this nature. And many times Oratours do uſe ſuch <hi>Fictions</hi> in their Orations; as that of <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> of the diſſenſion there was between the belly and the other parts of the body. And the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf uſes theſe ſometimes; as that of the Son of <hi>Geaeon,</hi> of the Trees that choſe themſelves a King. <hi>Parables</hi> alſo are a kind of inſtructing, Moral Fiction; as that of <hi>Gad</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> of the Poor man and his Sheep. And of ſuch Parables are the <hi>Goſpels</hi> full; and in the Diſcourſes of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> they are very frequent. But theſe things have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing common, nor do not relate to that, of which we treat now. The queſtion is, Whether the Hiſtories of the Old and New Teſtament are Tales, and Fables; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Relations of things, that have really and truely came to paſs.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who do write <hi>Apologues, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> &amp;c. do not write them for true Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: they ſhew plainly enough, that they ſpeak ſuch things meerly to inſtruct, and not for things, that have really happened. But the Sacred Writers do give us their Hiſtories for the true Narrations of things, which really came to paſs.</p>
               <p>And this is evident, becauſe they do note all the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170457:83"/>crcumſtances, and particularities, which are obſerved in true Hiſtories, and by which we are wont to diſcern <hi>Romances,</hi> and Poetical Fictions from true Narrations.</p>
               <p>They would have us to hold, and believe thoſe Narrations for very truths, and things, which have really and certainly happened. To what end ſhould this be if their Narrations are but Dreams? Do thoſe good VVriters, that will inſtruct and profit, uſe ſuch means? In no wiſe. And although one would write ſome Moraliz'd <hi>Romance,</hi> to inſtruct men; yet would not he publiſh it for a true Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Beſides, that we have noted before, that theſe Sacred Hiſtories have none of the ſtile and garb of <hi>Romances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the Doctrines, Sayings, and Sentences, of which the Sacred Books are full, will the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> ſay, that they are <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes,</hi> wild and extravagant opinions? If it is ſo, I will ask them, To what good end could ſuch things have been forged and invented? For we have ſhewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, that they could not be invented to any ill intent, or pernicious deſign. If they are meer Inventions, and that there is no reality in them, to what good end can they have been invented?</p>
               <p>Moreover, theſe Sacred Authours do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe Doctrines, that men may ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170457:83"/>believe them, and that they may be held for undoubted truths; can there be any good or reaſonable end in this, if theſe things are in effect but Extravagancies?</p>
               <p>VVill they ſay, that theſe Perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to win men to the exerciſe of Virtue, Juſtice, Temperance, Fortitude, Truth, Faithfullneſs, Friendſhip, Charity, Patience, Honour, Reſpect, Obedience, Obſervation of the Laws of Humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did think that the perſwaſion (though a falſe one) of a God, Creatour, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of this Univerſe, Judge, Avenger, and Remuneratour of the good and evill; and that the examples (though but fictitious and falſe) of Vices and Virtues, which are rewarded, or puniſhed by a Providence, would be a Powerfull motive to induce men to attain this end? And that this is it, which hath made them to invent this opinion of a Providence, with all the conſequences of it, and to compile all theſe Stories to Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize Vices and Virtues? Almoſt as <hi>Horace</hi> doth pretend (in that Epiſtle which begins, <hi>Trojani belli Scriptorem, Maxime L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lli,</hi>) that <hi>Homer,</hi> in his <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odyſſea,</hi> doth tell us all theſe fine Tales, and Stories, to ſerve as Morall documents unto all men. It is very true, that the beliefe of a God, ſuch as he is repreſented to us in the Sacred
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170457:84"/>Writings, is the true, and only meanes, and the moſt ſtrong and efficacious motive, to induce men to true Virtue, as it appears by the Examples of the Lives of the truely-faithfull under both the Teſtaments: in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of which the moſt ſplendid Virtue of the Heathen is but droſs and dung; As an exact compariſon of them would eaſily verifie. And the firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fathers, that have writ againſt the vanity of the Heathen, ſhewed this evidently; as <hi>Tertullian, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius Felix,</hi> and others. But it is alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, that, if this perſwaſion of a Deity and Providence, ſuch as it is repreſented to us by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, was falſe and imaginary, it could not produce ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as to induce men to exerciſe the true Virtue.</p>
               <p>And we may not Object, that an opinion, though falſe, if it be believed for true and certain, doth produce the ſame effect, as if it were really true; as many Examples do teſtifie.</p>
               <p>For thoſe falſe impreſſions, which the mind receives, do laſt but for a little while. They deceive only for a ſmall time. It is as paint upon a face, which for a time doth give ſome luſtre; but abideth not. But this belief of a Deity, and Providence, is ſtable, and as conſtant, and unalterable, as the Heavens.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170457:84"/>And it is not a Fiction of the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: For thoſe, that never heard of them. or ſaw their Writings, have had, and yet have, this perſwaſion; for we have ſhewed heretofore, that all men in all ages were perſwaded, there was a Deity, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>There is alſo too manifeſt, and palpable a difference, between the Fables and Poetical Fictions of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the Narrations of Holy Writ. It was not <hi>Homer's</hi> intention, (if his deſign was ſuch, as <hi>Horace</hi> tells us it was, <hi>viz.</hi> to inſtruct, and pleaſe men by his Fables) that we ſhould take his Fables for Truths: Nor hath he divulged theſe Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for true Hiſtories; but compoſed only a fine Moraliz'd <hi>Romance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (as we have ſaid) the Sacred Writers do tell us their Hiſtories, as certain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable things. And as to the falſe Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Homer,</hi> and to all thoſe things he tells of them, I think, that there is none of the ſtrong Wits at this day dares maintaine without bluſhing, but that, which the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion doth teach of a God, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, Preſerver, Judge and Governour of all this Univerſe; of his Cult and Service; and of the meanes to attain to true happineſs by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> alone, is farr more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170457:85"/>to the Deity, (if there is any) and alſo more conformable to right Reaſon, then all the fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Tales of the falſe Gods of <hi>Homer;</hi> yea, then what he hath beſt, and more refined concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deity.</p>
               <p>So then, it is unreaſonable to ſay of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred VVriters of the Old and New Teſtament, that they have invented, or got from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that preceded them, the things, that they reach us in their VVritings. All manner of reaſon is againſt this. To theſe I will add ſome few remarks, which may ſerve as a Modell for any one, who will treat of this matter more at large, as well it may be done.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Wherein there follow ſome more Proofs of the Divinity of the Holy <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THoſe things, which are contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, are two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Doctrines, and Hiſtories. Neither of theſe can proceed from man's or Devils inventions. The Doctrines alſo are two fold: 1. <hi>Dogmata;</hi> ſo properly called, becauſe they are delivered, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our faith and knowledge: as that there is a God, a <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Son of God, Saviour and Redeemer of the VVorld. 2. <hi>Moral Doctrines;</hi> which are converſant in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of life, and exerciſe of Virtue.</p>
               <p>Theſe Doctrines, which reſpect Faith and Knowledge, are ſo high, ſo ſublime, ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſo admirable, ſo profound and abſtruſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially thoſe Myſteries of the Trinity, Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Redemption; that the Soul of man is not at all capable to comprehend them, ſo as to have invented, or divined ſuch things:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170457:86"/>and they are ſo contrary to the humour, nature, and Genius of the Devil; that he could not, nor would not, have thought or invented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch things, much leſs would he have taught them unto men. And if theſe things are falſe, good Angels would not have invented them; ſuch a Fiction, being wholy repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant to their integrity.</p>
               <p>And as to the Moral Precepts, they contain ſo exact, perfect, and incomparable a form of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (to which all the Virtues of the moſt noted Heathen Philoſophers comes nothing near) that ſinful and corrupted man, as he is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to evil, could not have invented ſo perfect a Rule to live by, as that which is ſhewed unto us there. Much leſs is the Devil Authour of cheſe things who is ſo great an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all Virtue and Holineſs, that he would not have recommended -or taught it unto men.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if <hi>Damons</hi> are granted to be, it muſt be conſequently acknowledged, That there is a God; as hath been ſhewed before. Whence it appears that theſe things proceed neceſſarily from Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p>As to the Narrations and Hiſtories, they are ſo tyed and connexed unto the Doctrines, that they cannot be ſeparated one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that, if the Hiſtories are true, and no forged things; the Doctrines, which are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170457:86"/>annexed to them, muſt needs alſo be true. For in every part of them you have a God, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and Governour of Heaven and Earth, repreſented to you, who doth ſee, conduct, and order all things; a Judge of men, who pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth and chaſtiſeth the one, and doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and recompenſe the others; who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wonders above and beyond all Natures Power; who ſtiles, and in effect ſhews himſelf to be ſuch, as he is there deſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Infinite, Immortal, Inviſible, Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, Almighty, VViſe, Good, Juſt, and Mercifull <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVe ſee in the New Teſtament a man (<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> our Lord) ſtiling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>The Son of God,</hi> and <hi>The Saviour of the World,</hi> ſhewing and evidencing by his Miracles, that he was indeed ſuch a one; dying for mens ſalvation, ariſing again, aſcending into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and there ſitting at the right hand of God his Father, and ſending from thence the Holy Spirit upon his Apoſtles. There he is ſeen miniſtred to by Angels, preached to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, believed in the World, and by the ſtrength of his Spirit bearing down all Heatheniſh I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and Superſtition, demoliſhing the empire of the Devil, and triumphing gloriouſly over <hi>Sathan,</hi> and over all his Power.</p>
               <p>Theſe Narrations are not Fables artificially invented, as thoſe of <hi>Homer,</hi> and thoſe of the Old and New <hi>Romancès</hi> of all ſorts;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170457:87"/>but are true Hiſtories, and genuine Relations of things, which have really and certainly came to paſs, ſo as they are there related to us.</p>
               <p>Which appears, Firſt by the Connexion, and admirable contexture of theſe Relations, which do ſtrengthen, follow, and maintain one another with ſo exact and juſt an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there is nothing there unjoynted, or that doth bely any other matter therein contained. Which in ſo great a multitude, and variety of Narrations, ſo well continued with all their Circumſtances of Times, Places, and Perſons, (and of which we do ſee many Traces, and Footſteps, in the moſt authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and certain Monuments of Antiquity) and ſo well continued by ſo many Ages from the Beginning of the World to our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for the ſpace of four thouſand years (add to this the connexion and coherence there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Relations and Doctrines of the New Teſtament with thoſe of the Old) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have been compiled, nor ſo admirably invented by any humane Induſtry, though ſuch a Writer had been as ſubtile, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious as it may be; although one man alone (which is not true) had undertaken to write and continue ſuch a deſign, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore invented out of his own brain. Much leſs could it be, that ſo many, and ſo different Writers, as to Time, and Place; ſome in the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170457:87"/>Deſart, others in <hi>Judea,</hi> others in <hi>Babylon,</hi> others in <hi>Samaria;</hi> (two Kingdomes ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and Enemies one to the other) ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (two people ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) in ſuch a wonderfull variety of matters, and ſo differing arguments of their Writings; as are Hiſtories, Laws, Political and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Ordinances, Moral Precepts, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of many kinds, Epiſtles, Diſcourſes, Diſputes, of ſo differing ſtiles, the one low, genuine, and popular; the other figurate, and ſublime, (to which all humane Eloquence cannot attain) the one terſe and poliſhed, the other harſh and unpleaſing: it is (I ſay) impoſſible, that ſo many, and ſo different heads, which have neither ſeen, known, nor combined together, ſhould have ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in all points to divulge, and put forth, and give credit to a Fable ſo well continued, and to ſuit ſo wonderfully all the Narrations, Doctrines, and Precepts, which they lay there before us.</p>
               <p>Secondly it appears, That theſe are not ſabulous Narrations and Tales, made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the VVorld; becauſe the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Origin and Hiſtory of which is held forth to us in the Old Teſtament, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for the ſpace of two thouſand years, and which is almoſt all the ſubject matter of all the Books of the Old Teſtament, and makes a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170457:88"/>good part of the Books of the New Teſtament, is, and doth ſubſiſt yet at this day ſcattered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the Earth, even ſo, as their own Prophets had fore-told them. Their Sanctions, Cuſtomes, Ceremonies, and Religion, the very ſame, as was preſcribed to them by their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the <hi>Prophets.</hi> It cannot be denied, that <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> have been, and have Preached in the World; ſince that their Doctrine and their Writings are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and held by ſo many millions of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which have been for theſe 1600. years up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, known, and noted among men. But, it may be it wil be objected, that the ground and <hi>baſis</hi> of theſe Hiſtories is true; and hath ſome reality in it; that there have been a <hi>Moſes, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, Judges,</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> &amp;c. but that theſe Hiſtories have been ſluffed, and garniſhed with Fictitious Tales; as <hi>Homer's Iliad,</hi> and <hi>Odyſsea:</hi> the Foundation of which is Hiſtorical, ſince that once <hi>Troy, Priam, Hector, Achilles,</hi> had a real being; but they have not done all that <hi>Homer</hi> tells and writes of them: and as the <hi>Romances</hi> of <hi>Roland</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnault,</hi> who once were, but never did that which the <hi>Romances,</hi> written of them, tell us. So the Miracles and Wonders of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of the <hi>Deſart,</hi> of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> of the <hi>Judges,</hi> of the <hi>Kings,</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> are Ornaments invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170457:88"/>by theſe Writers, to ſet an higher value on what they preſent there to us.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee, whether there is any ground of Reaſon in this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> writes himſelf his own Hiſtory, and that of the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which he had drawn from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and led through the <hi>Deſart</hi> for the ſpace of fourty years, with ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable an ingenuity, and ſo far from ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of fraud or deceit; that he notes there his own defects and faults, and doth not beſtow the moſt Honourable charges of this People, the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> or <hi>Royalty,</hi> upon any of his Poſterity. And, a little before his death, he makes a long Sermon to them (which is all the Book of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy</hi>) where he repreſents to them all things, that had befallen them in the <hi>Deſart,</hi> and a little before their going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> juſt in the ſame manner, as he relates it in the Books of <hi>Exodus, Leviticus,</hi> and <hi>Numbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was it then any time, place, and likelihood, that they could be made to believe forged Tales? and could he take them to witneſs thoſe things, which they never ſaw, nor knew?</p>
               <p>Will it be ſaid, That he never made this Sermon? That we only ſuppoſe it to be ſo? That he hath not writ theſe Books? Or, That theſe Writings, ſo repleniſhed of Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Stories, have been hid for a long time, and have not been publiſhed of a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170457:89"/>great while after he was dead; when the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of thoſe things, which happened at the going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the Deſart, was paſt and aboliſh'd in this people, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad, and content to receive, and believe theſe fine Tales, as tending to the Honour of their Nation? Or, elſe will it be objected, That ſome body after his death hath fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and publiſhed theſe Books under his Name.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This is objected, without the leaſt Colour, Appearance, or Ground in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is againſt the Teſtimony of the moſt ancient Monuments of Hiſtory, which father theſe Books upon none other then <hi>Moſes,</hi> and accuſe no body of having compiled them for him. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> writeth, that <hi>Moſes</hi> gave the <hi>Jews</hi> their Laws, and that he received them from the God called <hi>Jaoh,</hi> which is the proper Name of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Authour of thoſe Books doth not flatter that Nation; but repreſent it to us, as the moſt perverſe and ſtiff-necked in the World.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, How could theſe pretended im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures have ſo univerſally, in ſo many Ages, taken ſo deep a rooting in the ſpirit of this Nation?</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:170457:89"/>
               <p>Fifthly, The beſt part of their Laws, and Political and Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions, are grounded, and have their Foundation upon theſe Narrations, which theſe men do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be fabulous: Theſe, I ſay, are wholy built upon them; as the Paſs-over, the Feaſt of Tabernacles, the Jubilee, the year of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, The Tabernacle, ſo ſplendid, ſo ingeniouſly and artificially erected, ſo divine and admirable, (by whoſe Model, and Pattern, <hi>Solomon,</hi> that glorious and magnificent King, hath afterwards builded his Temple) that ſtupendious and wonderfull piece of workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (to which the moſt ſumptuous Buildings, which the Vanity, Power, and Riches of the moſt potent Monarchs have erected, is nothing comparable) with all its Services, and the Order of its Ceremonies, which is ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; where all the Myſteries of Chriſtian Faith, and Religion, are ſeen pourtraied, and, as it were, drawn to the Life: (as we know it by the Relation, which the Sacred Writers of the New Teſtament do make, and, in their imitation, the Fathers and Doctours of the Church) could this be an Invention and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara</hi> of <hi>Moſes's</hi> own fancying, or of ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe after him? Could he have divined ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages before all that our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould do, teach, and ſuffer for the Salvation
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170457:90"/>of men, and accordingly erect this Tabernacle with all its Ceremonies, and Appertenances, which were ſo perfect and accompliſhed a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of theſe things?</p>
               <p>Now, ſince there is no ground to doubt, that <hi>Moſes</hi> hath invented theſe things, which he writeth of the Children of <hi>Iſrael's</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, of their going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or their going through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures through the <hi>Deſart</hi> for the ſpace of fourty years; ſince he relates theſe things, himſelf, to a multitude of ſix hundred thouſand men, which could have given him the lye, if he had forged theſe things: Why ſhould not he be believed in all thoſe things, which he recites to us, in the Hiſtories of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and his Children, of the Deluge, of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and (to go yet higher) of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World? What is in all this more incredible, then the Hiſtory of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the <hi>Deſart?</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of all that, which is recited to us in the Books of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> of the <hi>Judges,</hi> and of the <hi>Kings:</hi> for all this is not more incredible, then this Hiſtory of <hi>Egypt.</hi> and of the <hi>Deſart;</hi> and it hath an indiſſoluble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with all the Narrations of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And why ſhall we eſteem them paſt belief, ſince they are repreſented to us, as the Works
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170457:90"/>and Effects of a God, which is Eternal, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, Almighty, All-good, All-wiſe, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely-exalted above Nature; ſeeing it is he, who hath given its being to Nature? And that we have ſhewed by ſo many preceding Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that above this Nature there ought to be ſuch a Deity, the Cauſe and Riſe of it.</p>
               <p>Again, It cannot be denyed, but that <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, have promiſed, and fore-told, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould come: and he came. The <hi>Jews</hi> expected him; they thinking that his time was come, or near at hand. For to this very day they are forced to confeſs, that that time is paſt by above fifteen hundred years. And when they are urged upon this Confeſſion, they have preſently recourſe to a pitifull, and impertinent eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; to wit, that this time hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, becauſe of their ſins, and that the coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> hath been retarded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account: although they are not able to ſhew what great ſin they have committed, that may have been the cauſe of this delay, and of ſo ſignal a Deſolation in their Nation. And the Apoſtles, and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> do evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, that this promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> is come in the time prefixed by their Prophets; and that this is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom they have rejected upon no other account, but that they falſly imagined to themſelves, that the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170457:91"/>
                  <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to be a Great and Potent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, who was to free them from the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very they ſuffered under the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and give them Domination over all other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Earth; An imagination quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the intention of the Spirit of God, which the Prophets were inſpired withall.</p>
               <p>Neither can it be denyed, but that <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles after them, have fore-told the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the Temple by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and that miſerable Diſperſion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, wherein they have been for ſo many Ages; their Rejection; their Excluſion from the Covenants of God; and the Vocation of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their ſtead, and their being brought to the Service of the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who is Creatour of Heaven and Earth; with the utter aboliſhing of all the Heatheniſh Superftition. All which hath came to paſs ſince theſe ſixteen hundred years, as it was fore-told by them: which is an invincible Argument, that theſe Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not made at adventure; neither can they be any product of Humane Wit, which cannot dive ſo far into Future Events, nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell ſo certainly and conſtantly, by ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſon, thoſe wonderfull Effects, which ſo many Ages ſince have came to paſs.</p>
               <p>To theſe we might add the Miracles of <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170457:91"/>Chriſt,</hi> and of his Apoſtles, which the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelvs, though they be their ſworn enemies, do not deny: although they falſly and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly impute them to I know not what ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Virtue of the Name of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which they ſay was diſcovered by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſtolen by him out of their Temple; and partly to the Efficacy and Illuſion of <hi>Daemons,</hi> and Magical Arts, of which they ſay they had knowledge: which is the fooliſh and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Exception of theſe deſperate perſons, which chooſe rather to ſpeak all manner of Impertinencies, then to confeſs the Truth.</p>
               <p>The admirable Virtue and Efficacy of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which, by ſo weak Inſtruments as were the Apoſtles, and their firſt Succeſſours, notwithſtanding all the Contradiction, Oppoſition, and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, hath been received in the World, and hath aboliſhed all the Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Idolatry, and Superſtition; which hath produced ſo wonderfull, and exemplary Righteouſneſs, Uprightneſs, Integrity, and Holineſs of Life in the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> which hath raviſhed into Admiration their Perſecutours themſelves; and which hath made men to reſolve to loſe voluntarily all that is ſweet, pleaſing, agreeable, and moſt charming the fleſh in this Life, and to ſuffer all that, which is moſt harſh, and horrible, for
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170457:92"/>the hope of another Life after this: This Power, I ſay, and this ſo wonderfull Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine in the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of it, is a Proof, and an invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Divinity of it, and that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Fiction, or Invention of man's brain. And ſo conſequently, that ſince this Doctrine is no where elſe Originally to be found, then in the Writings of the Old and New Tefta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it muſt needs be, that theſe firſt Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have received it from God, who hath revealed it to men, to teach and publiſh it to other men; that it might induce them to that Holineſs, Uprightneſs, and Integrity of Life, to that Patience, and Forbearance, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and incomparable Goodneſs, which it hath cauſed in thoſe men, who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it: and thereby bring them to the fruition of that Eternal Life, and Felicity, which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth.</p>
               <p>And, if it hath not alwaies, and at all times, and moſt eſpecially at this day, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced theſe ſo admirable Effects, in all thoſe that make Profeſſion of it, it is not for any defect, that is in the Doctrine: but it is the fault of thoſe, that make Profeſſion of it, who have not that true Faith and Perſwaſion, which they profeſs to have. But neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there will alwaies be found amongſt true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> more Holineſs, Juſtice, Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170457:92"/>Righteouſneſs, and Integrity of Life, more Humility, Patience, Courage, Virtue, and Conſtancy, more true Piety, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then in any other Religion in the World, and then can ever be found amongſt thoſe, that teach and follow <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> which we oppoſe: whoſe Profeſſion is quite contrary to this, and hath no other end, then to carry men to all kinds of Vice, Filthineſs, Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Injuſtice.</p>
               <p>Theſe Proofs and Arguments of the Divinity of the Holy Scriptures might be enlarged, and amplified, many others might be here added, &amp; great Volumes might be writ on this Subject, and it may be, that ſome after us will undertake this task: But this ſufficeth for our purpoſe, and it is enough to ſhut the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane; that is, to reduce them to ſay nought, but fooleries, and impertinencies, and to ſhew themſelves altogether ridiculous, and abſurd in diſputing againſt ſo many invincible Arguments of the Divinity of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
               <p>Now, as to thoſe that call themſelves the <hi>Church,</hi> and who, upon this account, do pretend, that we cannot, nor ought not, to give credit to the Scripture; but becauſe they give it this Teſtimony, That it is Divine: If they will be believed, they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily do two things.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:170457:93"/>
               <p>Firſt, They muſt ſhew, that all the fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments are invalid, and of no moment, and are in no wiſe capable to perſwade to any man the Divinity of the Scriptures: yea, they muſt even ſay, That there is nothing at all in the Scriptures, which is able to make us to diſcern the Divinity and Truth of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They muſt ſhew, that, as for their part, they have in themſelves Reaſons, Proofs, and Arguments, much ſtronger, clearer, and evident, more demonſtrative, and uncontroulable, to evince, that they are more Divine and Infallible then the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: and that therefore they ought rather to be believed in whatſoever they ſay, then any thing, that is taught in theſe Books; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themſelves incomparably more Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Divine, then this Volume of Holy Writ, which is contained in the Books of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Now I ſuppoſe, that they would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to demonſtrate theſe two things: and if they would come to the triall of it, they ſhould finde themſelves very buſie, and their Proofs would be found invalid, their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reaſonings very weak, yea none at all. For, although they had confuted theſe Reaſons, which we have here mentioned: where will they finde any ſtronger, or more invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prove, that they are more Divine, then
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170457:93"/>the Holy Scriptures? For, for them to force men to believe them upon their bare word, without any reaſon ſhew'd why we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, that they are Infallible, it is to deal too injuſtly, and too unworthily to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the patience and credulity of men. And to ſay, as they do, That we ought to believe them to be Infallible; becauſe our Lord hath ſaid to St. <hi>Peter, I prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not:</hi> and, <hi>I will give thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> grant even this, (which we deny them) that the ſenſe of theſe words was ſuch, as they would have it to be; yet it is alwaies to acknowledge by this, that we are perſwaded of the Divinity of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> where theſe words are found, before we can ever be certain of the Infallibility of thoſe, to whom they pretend theſe words are directed. And therefore the belief, which we have of the Divinity of the Scriptures, is not grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Teſtimony of thoſe, to whom they would have us believe the Scripture renders, in the fore-cited words, ſo clear and ſolemn teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Infallibility. It is therefore an ill-grounded and vain preſumption in them to ſay, <hi>That the Scripture can have no more credit with us then</hi> Aeſop's Fables, <hi>or</hi> Mahomet's Alcoran, <hi>if it were not for the Teſtimony they give, that it is Divine:</hi> ſince that they themſelves draw from it, and from its Teſtimony (as they do pretend)
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170457:94"/>all the Infallibility they ſo much boaſt of.</p>
               <p>But let this be ſaid onely by the by, for the maintaining more ſtrongly the Divinity of the Holy Scriptures againſt the <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> which thoſe men, by ſuch an Aſſertion, do wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and thereby expoſe, at unawares, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion to the profane mockings of the <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> who will ask theſe Gentlemen, with reaſon enough, that they demonſtrate to them, by good and ſolid Reaſons, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Arguments, their pretended Infallibility, which ought to oblige all the World to believe the Teſtimony they render to the Scripture, That it is Divine; and that therefore all, that is therein contained and taught, ought to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly believed, as a moſt firm Truth. And let them, that give them ſo much credit, as to build their Faith upon their bare word, acknowledge, that this is no better then to bring themſelves inſenſibly to direct <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Wherein is contained a Confutation of the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> Arguments.</head>
               <p>WE muſt now examine the Reaſons of theſe perſons, to ſee whether they can out-ballance thoſe, which we have alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170457:94"/>them. And in this we are forced to be brief. For, ſeeing that we are not (God be thanked) bred in the Schole of ſuch people, and having no converſe with them, and they not putting to light their Arguments in their defence; either for ſhame, or for fear, or cowardlineſs; (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy that greatneſs of Wit and Parts, which they boaſt to have above all men, whom they count in this point worſe then children) or rather, becauſe they are conſcious of their own weakneſs: I cannot divine their thoughts, nor what theſe pretended ſtrong Reaſons ſhould be, upon which they ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And I am forced to mention onely three, which ſome may uſe in their own defence, and which may come in many mens thoughts.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is taken from the Eternity of the World, which they think muſt needs have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted from everlaſting; becauſe there is not any thing, that can be produced out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and cannot (as they think) return into Nothing; according to the ſaying of ſome one of their Maſters, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil, in nihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum nil poſſe redire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second, That there are ſo many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances in Nature; as the Monſters: ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſorders in it, ſo many things of no Uſe, and againſt Reaſon; either in the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Bodies of Plants and Animals, or in the diſpoſition of the World, and of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170457:95"/>Earth; as great Rocks in a fair Meadow, or in a fertile Field, or the Rain falling unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably upon the Sea, upon the Sands of <hi>Lybia,</hi> and upon the Rocks; and a thouſand like things. So, that it ſeems, that theſe things do not proceed from ſome wiſe Providence, that hath ſo diſpoſed of them; but from the Fate and Hazard, that hath ordered them ſo at an adventure. There are ſo many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, Diſaſters, Miſhaps, which befall thoſe, that do leſs deſerve it; ſo much Good and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, which happeneth to thoſe, that do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſerve all manner of ſupplices; ſo much VVickedneſs, which remains unpuniſhed: All which could not come to paſs, if the VVorld was guided by a Providence.</p>
               <p>And Finally, That there are in all the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World ſo many ſtrange and abſurd Opinions and practiſes, ſo contrary to right Reaſon, and to true VViſdom, that we muſt acknowledge, they are not grounded in the truth. Of all which abſurdities the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> (as they ſay) is free.</p>
               <p>As to the Firſt of theſe Arguments, which is the chiefeſt they have; If the Deity had a limited power, ſtrength, and power, as the ſtrength and power of Nature is, then they would have reaſon to ſay, that there is not any thing, which can be made of Nothing; there being an infinite diſtance between meer
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170457:95"/>Nothing, and that which Is. And therefore Naturally Nothing can be produced out of Nothing; and ſo it is, that in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Nature there is alway ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain matter, which is the Subject of it, and from the power of which all thoſe Forms, which we ſee to ſucceed one to the other, are educed. But God, being neceſſarily Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, is it any waies againſt Reaſon, (yea, is not it very agreeable to Reaſon?) that by his Virtue and Power, which is Infinite, and without any limits, he ſhould create out of Nothing Something, that may reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or Infinite diſtance, which is between being Something and Nothing?</p>
               <p>The Effect of a Finite Power ought to be Finite; but that of an Infinite one may, and ought to be Infinite alſo. Now the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World is extracted out of Nothing, by the Infinite Power of God; I ſay, that it is an Infinite Effect, not in reſpect of its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is Finite; (there being no body which can be actually Infinite) but in regard of its Production, and the means of it, as it is a product from a meer Nothing, which hath no Intrinſecal Cauſe, or Virtue, there being none ſuch in Nothing; but by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal virtue, which is unlimited; and ſuch neceſſarily is God.</p>
               <p>For God, being without any beginning or
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170457:96"/>ending, (otherwiſe he could not be God) it muſt of neceſſity follow, that to ſubſiſt of himſelf from all Eternity to all Eternity, by an infinite ſpace of time, (ſo as we can comprehend Eternity) he hath in himſelfe a Virtue, and Power, altogether Infinite, and unlimited; by which Power he hath been able to Create, and in effect hath Created out of Nothing this World: which although it is very great, and in a manner infinite in reſpect of us, is nevertheleſs very ſmall, and leſs then a point in reſpect of God: who in reſpect of the extent of Places, and Spaces, is alſo Infinite; as he is in reſpect of Time, and Duration. Not, that there can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God (to ſpeak properly) any Time, or Place; for in Time and Place there is <hi>pars extra partem,</hi> and <hi>prius &amp; poſterius;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Eternity of God there is no <hi>prius &amp; poſterius.</hi> Neither in his Immenſity is there <hi>pars extra partem:</hi> for he hath no Extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Bodies have; for there is no Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in God. But becauſe we are corporeal, and do reaſon by the help of corporeal ſenſes, we do conceive the Eternity and Immenſity of God under that, which we call Time and Place; as if Eternity was an Infinite Time, and Immenſity a Place and Space Infinite; though Reaſon in effect doth judge, that there cannot be any Place, or Time actually Infinite.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:170457:96"/>
               <p>God then, being of neceſſity actually Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and his Power alſo Infinite, and ſince the World cannot have exiſted from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, as we have heretofore demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it muſt needs follow; That it hath been Created by him out of Nothing: and there is no Reaſon to wonder at this, ſince his Power is Infinite. So we have laid their ſtout <hi>Achilles</hi> down.</p>
               <p>There are ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Philoſophers, that dare not ſay, That the World is from all Eternity; becauſe the Scripture doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſignifie to us its Beginning and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: but they hold nevertheleſs, that the World could have been created by God from all Eternity, if it had pleaſed him ſo to do: becauſe an Effect may be of the ſame ſtanding with its Cauſe; as the Light is as ancient as the Sun, and the print of ones foot on the ſand may be as old as the foot, which ſtamped it. But the Arguments, by which we have evidenced, That the World is not Eternal, do abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of this Truth; and conſequently that it was not Created <hi>ab aterno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Reaſon, Why God cannot have created the World <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> is, not for any want of Power to do this; but becauſe ſuch an Effect cannot be, nor cannot have had anex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence without a Beginning. And God, being (as he is) Infinitely-wiſe, will not do that which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170457:97"/>implies a Contradiction. And it doth not in any wayes avail to object, That his Son was genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from everlaſting. For the Son of God is a true God, of the ſame Eſſence and Nature with his Father, Coeternal, and Infinite as God is, in whom there is no <hi>prius &amp; poſterius:</hi> but the World is finite, and cannot be otherwiſe then finite; becauſe it is corporeal, and cannot be abſolutely eternal.</p>
               <p>And, if it is asked, Why the World hath been Created but five or ſix thouſand years ago, I anſwer, that it is, Becauſe God would have it ſo, who knows by his Wiſdome the Reaſons of it, which it doth not belong to us to ſeek after, neither ought we to fathom this Abyſs. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it had been Created fifty thouſand, yea, five hundred thouſand millions of years before; yet hath it had a Beginning. And if this were granted, yet it can no ways further the cauſe of the <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> who would have the World to be without a Beginning, and who prevail not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the World is really exiſtent from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And we may not queſtion whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded this will in God to Create the World: for it is not any will, which he had in any time. He hath willed and decreed from all Eternity to Create the World then, and in that moment of time, (that we may ſo ſay) which ſeemed good unto him, and when that time is come, he hath executed this his will. When I ſay, <hi>In
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170457:97"/>that point and moment of time, which pleaſed him;</hi> that muſt be underſtood in regard of the Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which hath preceded the VVorld; for in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity there is not (to ſpeak properly) any points or moments of Time, there being in it no <hi>prius &amp; poſterius:</hi> But this ought to be underſtood in reſpect of the Exiſtency of the VVorld, which ought neceſſarily to have had a Beginning: ſince it cannot be from all Eternity; as it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. And it is to no purpoſe to Object, That if this was ſo, then there would be ſome change in God, who ſhould have at that time, and no ſooner Created the VVorld. For the VVorld is not in God, but out of him; and is not an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or Product of his Eſſence, but of Nothing; and ſo the change is not in God, but out of God: becauſe the VVorld, which was not before, hath began to exiſt in a certain Time which time (as I have ſaid) we ought to conſider in the exiſtency of the VVorld, and hath begun with it: for in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity there is no Time properly ſo called. And ſo much for the firſt Argument.</p>
               <p>For the Second, We have heretofore ſhewed, That theſe pretended diſorders &amp; exorbitancies, which are ſeen in Nature, and in Humane actions, and events, do in no wiſe favour the cauſe of the <hi>Atheists:</hi> yea, we have from this drawn an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt them, becauſe we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in this not a blind Fate, and Fortune; but a wiſe, and ſuperiour Cauſe, which doth regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late theſe diſorders, and limits them; otherwiſe all
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170457:98"/>things would return in an horrible and monſtrous confuſion. And, although we cannot always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the reaſon of this diſorder, ſo wonderfully guided, we may not therefore conclude, That it is not guided. A common Souldier doth not alway underſtand the reaſon of his Generals Orders and Commands; which yet if he ſhould be ſo bold as to cenſure, or to accuſe his General of inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, he ſhould render himſelf criminal, and would betray his ignorance: ſuch are theſe people, who do cenſure the works of God, and do attribute them to a blind Fate, becauſe they cannot ſee into the counſels of him, who hath ſo determined of theſe things. The Proſperity of the VVicked, and the Afflictions of the Righteous and Good men, was not an Argument even to the Heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, That all things were guided by a blind Fate and hazard: they themſelves in this have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and demonſtrated, That there is a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which doth ſo diſpoſe of theſe things. And God in his word doth yet more clearly, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diſtinctly, then they, give us the Reaſons of his Juſtice, Wiſdom, and Bounty in this his conduct, againſt which all the Reaſonings of the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> break themſelves, as a Wave againſt a Rock: and therefore there is no need to enlarge upon this ſubject; ſince the beſt Philoſophy, &amp; the evidences of Revelation, teach us in this point, that from this conduct we ought rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That there is another life after this, then to deny the Providence, and Deity.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:170457:98"/>
               <p>So now we come to the Third Argument. It is certain, that the abſurd and extravagant Opinions of the Heathen, concerning the Multitude and Diverſity of their falſe Gods, the Service they did to them, the Fabulous Stories, which they made of them, and upon which all their Religion was grounded, have given to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with him, matter enough of laughter, and to jear their Impertinencies, to deride their vain Superſtitions, and deſpiſe all their Religion. Yea, it hath been a ſtumbling-block to them, and hath given them occaſion to become <hi>Atheiſts;</hi> being deſtitute of the Divine Revelation, which affords to us the right knowledge, which we ought to have of the Deity. In which they are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excuſable, ſeeing that they could by the uſe of right Reaſon (as well as other Philoſophers, wiſer then themſelves) acknowledge and confeſs one onely God, and that the Cult, which is due to him, ought to have been ſomewhat elſe, then the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Superſtitions. And we do not deny, but that in other falſe Religions, yea, even in the Sects and Hereſies which are among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> there are very extravagant, and abſurd, and wild Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practiſes in the matter of Religion: and it may be, that theſe extravagancies, wild practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and opinions, in theſe laſt days of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Church, have given an occaſion to <hi>Atheiſm</hi> to diffuſe it ſelf, and to multiply amongſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> And ſuch abſurdities do ſerve to foment, and encreaſe it; as the Authour of the <hi>Relation
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170457:99"/>of the Religion of the Weſtern World</hi> hath very well and judiciouſly remarked, ſpeaking of the common and ordinary Profaneſs of the <hi>Italians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this objection I anſwer two things. Firſt, That true <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> hath no ſuch Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as can ſtartle thoſe, who make a right uſe of their Reaſon. Secondly, That <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more irrational, and more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted then any of thoſe Extravagancies, which they with Reaſon do reject. There is nothing in the true and pure <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, which the word of God onely hath taught us, which can, or ought to offend any perſon of good ſenſe and judgement. Onely the Myſtery of the Trinity, and that of the Incarnation, is indeed above our apprehenſion, and carnal ſenſe, which cannot comprehend the <hi>Quomodo</hi> of it; but yet, as both theſe are ſimply propoſed, and laid open to us, and as we may gather them from the Revelation, which God hath made to us of them in his word, they are ſuch, as that they are not againſt pure and right Reaſon, enlightned by this Revelation; though it cannot fathom the depth of them. And what wonder is it, if our Reaſon, which is ſhort, weak, and blind, even about Natural things, (that the greateſt of Philoſophers hath compar'd it to the ſight of Owls at mid-day) cannot reach ſo far, as perfectly to apprehend, and underſtand ſo high a Myſtery, which is all that is moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime in the Divine Nature, which of it ſelf is Spiritual, Immaterial, Infinite, Eternal, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170457:99"/>and Incomprehenſible? It is farr a greater wonder, if the Opinion of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> is true, who acknowledge neither God, nor Angel, nor Spirit; that ſo high, ſo wonderfull and ſublime a thought, ſhould have entered into the ſpirit of man, wallowing in the mud, and who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor ought not, (according to their Opinion) to raiſe himſelf above corporeal ſenſes; being (as they think) altogether corporeal and ſenſual. How comes it to paſs, that ſo wonderfull Wiſdom, which ſhineth in all the Dogmes of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and particularly appears in theſe two My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, which are ſo wonderfully linked with the reſt of the Doctrine; how is it (I ſay) that this can be the product of ſuch a vile, and low ſoul, as they would have the ſoul of man to be; which is (as they think) compoſed of little <hi>Atoms,</hi> and Indiviſible Bodies, or which is nothing but a little refined Air, which by Death vaniſheth into nothing?</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> it is ſo far from being free from Extravagancies and Abſurdities, that it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full of them; as it appears evidently by what we have ſaid before: wherein we have convinced by many Arguments this monſtrous Opinion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which Arguments nothing but Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Abſurdities, and Impertinencies, can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>What Madneſs, and Extravagancy, is it to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that this VVorld is framed, and compoſed, by the fortuitous concourſe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,</hi> or ſmall Indiviſible Bodies? Or, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170457:100"/>to imagine, that it is without any beginning or ending, the ſame at this day, as it was 600000. millions of years before: which Opinion draws af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it all the imaginable Abſurdities, and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, that may be; as it hath been ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? And what an Impertinency is it, to attribute the Government of this admirable work, and the Conduct of this VVorld, and of the Affairs of all Humane kind, to two blind and oppoſite Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, <hi>viz.</hi> the inſenſible Fate and the temerary Hazard, &amp; inconſiderate Fortune, in which there is not a whit of Underſtanding, Prudence, or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg? What Abſurdity, &amp; Impertinency, is it to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more ſenſe, and underſtanding, to the moſt ſtupid of men, &amp; to the leaſt of all Animals, then to that, which doth move and conduct all this great Fabrick? For what is Fate in it ſelf, but a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> wanting all true exiſtence? And what is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſatal order of Nature, but a brutiſh thing, <hi>&amp; ſui neſcia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are not, to ſay truth, in the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion any of theſe ridiculous, abſurd, impertinent and wild extravagancies, practiſes, and uſes, which the ignorance, temerity, and ſuperſtition of men hath introduced in moſt of the falſe Religions; but that, which is more wild, &amp; monſtrous in them is, that they (as much as in them lies,) aboliſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh out of the world, all true Religion and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and drown men in impiety, profaneſs, &amp; irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which comprehends in it all ſorts of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Monſtroſities. For what is a man, that hath no
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170457:100"/>ſenſe, knowledge, nor fear, reverence, nor love, nor reſpect for the Deity, but the moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble monſter, that can be imagin'd? What honeſty, good, what virtue, or civility, can be hoped for, or expected from a man, that thinks, that all the difference there is between good and evil, vice &amp; virtue, is nought elſe, but an imagination, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends meerly from mans fancy, which would have it ſo, and not from the moſt perfect, immutable, &amp; eternal pattern of the Deity, the only model of all perfection, as well moral as Phyſical? Is not it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this <hi>Maxim,</hi> and opinion of the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> leads men directly to all kind of vice, pollution, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and Injuſtice, to which their concupiſcence, &amp; the pleaſure of their carnal ſenſe, may carry them, without any remorſe of conſcience, or fear of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other puniſhment, then that which may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them by men; which if any one of them ſhall hope, or think, to eſcape, he will let himſelf looſe to whatſoever his ſenſe ſhall dictate to him? For, according to their Principles, Reaſon, which dictates this to be good, and that to be evil, (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide the conſideration of the Deity, which is the pattern of Good) is nothing elſe according to their opinion, but a meer phantaſie, which may be chang'd, and which obligeth none, but to what they pleaſe to do. And doth not this lead directly to the overthrowing of all humane ſociety, and to the ſubverſion of all eſtates, bodies, &amp; commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the whole world &amp; ſo to the confuſion and ruine of all humane kind, and to the moſt horrible
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170457:101"/>
                  <hi>Chaos,</hi> that ever was feigned or imagined?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God, who is Gracious and Juſt, who reſideth in the higheſt Heaven, grant in his great Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that thoſe, who fear and reverence him, may be kept from this abominable precipice. Let him open the eyes of thoſe, who are led blind-fold by their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and the vanity of their corrupted Reaſon in this dangerous Abyſs, that they may ſee, and know, how terrible this Precipice is. Let him give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; Acknowledgment of their errour to the one, and Wiſdom to the other, that ſo they may never fall into it; and to overy one the right knowledge, fear, and reverence of his Holy Name, that he may be praiſed, ſerved, and glorified by all, as Honour, Fear, and Reverence, is moſt due unto him by all men eternally.</hi> Amen.</p>
